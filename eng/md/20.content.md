12let us swallow them alive like Sheol, and whole like those descending into the Pit.

14Throw in your lot with us; let us all share one purse”—

15my son, do not walk the road with them or set foot upon their path.

18But they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.


## Proverbs 1:19 (id: 120001019)

19Such is the fate of all who are greedy, whose unjust gain takes the lives of its possessors.

20Wisdom calls out in the street, she lifts her voice in the square;

21in the main concourse she cries aloud, at the city gates she makes her speech:


## Proverbs 1:22 (id: 120001022)

22“How long, O simple ones, will you love your simple ways? How long will scoffers delight in their scorn and fools hate knowledge?


## Proverbs 1:23 (id: 120001023)

23If you had repented at my rebuke, then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you; I would have made my words known to you.

24Because you refused my call, and no one took my outstretched hand,


## Proverbs 1:25 (id: 120001025)

25because you neglected all my counsel, and wanted none of my correction,


## Proverbs 1:26 (id: 120001026)

26in turn I will mock your calamity; I will sneer when terror strikes you,


## Proverbs 1:27 (id: 120001027)

27when your dread comes like a storm, and your destruction like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish overwhelm you.


## Proverbs 1:28 (id: 120001028)

28Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will earnestly seek me, but will not find me.


## Proverbs 1:29 (id: 120001029)

29For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the LORD.


## Proverbs 1:30 (id: 120001030)

30They accepted none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof.


## Proverbs 1:31 (id: 120001031)

31So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.


## Proverbs 1:32 (id: 120001032)

32For the waywardness of the simple will slay them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.

33But whoever listens to me will dwell in safety, secure from the fear of evil.”

2if you incline your ear to wisdom and direct your heart to understanding,


## Proverbs 2:3 (id: 120002003)

3if you truly call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,


## Proverbs 2:4 (id: 120002004)

12to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perversity,

13from those who leave the straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness,

14from those who enjoy doing evil and rejoice in the twistedness of evil,


## Proverbs 2:15 (id: 120002015)

15whose paths are crooked and whose ways are devious.

19None who go to her return or negotiate the paths of life.

7So now, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn aside from the words of my mouth.

10lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich the house of a foreigner.


## Proverbs 5:11 (id: 120005011)

11At the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are spent,


## Proverbs 5:12 (id: 120005012)

12and you will say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!


## Proverbs 5:13 (id: 120005013)

13I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my mentors.


## Proverbs 5:14 (id: 120005014)

14I am on the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.”


## Proverbs 5:15 (id: 120005015)

15Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well.


## Proverbs 5:16 (id: 120005016)

16Why should your springs flow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?


## Proverbs 5:17 (id: 120005017)

17Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.


## Proverbs 5:18 (id: 120005018)

18May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth:


## Proverbs 5:19 (id: 120005019)

19A loving doe, a graceful fawn—may her breasts satisfy you always; may you be captivated by her love forever.


## Proverbs 5:20 (id: 120005020)

20Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, or embrace the bosom of a stranger?


## Proverbs 5:21 (id: 120005021)

21For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD examines all his paths.


## Proverbs 5:22 (id: 120005022)

22The iniquities of a wicked man entrap him; the cords of his sin entangle him.


## Proverbs 5:23 (id: 120005023)

23He dies for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.


## Proverbs 6:1 (id: 120006001)

1My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger,


## Proverbs 6:2 (id: 120006002)

2if you have been trapped by the words of your lips, ensnared by the words of your mouth,


## Proverbs 6:3 (id: 120006003)

3then do this, my son, to free yourself, for you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go, humble yourself, and press your plea with your neighbor.


## Proverbs 6:4 (id: 120006004)

4Allow no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.


## Proverbs 6:5 (id: 120006005)

5Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.


## Proverbs 6:6 (id: 120006006)

6Walk in the manner of the ant, O slacker; observe its ways and become wise.


## Proverbs 6:7 (id: 120006007)

7Without a commander, without an overseer or ruler,


## Proverbs 6:8 (id: 120006008)

8it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food at harvest.


## Proverbs 6:9 (id: 120006009)

9How long will you lie there, O slacker? When will you get up from your sleep?


## Proverbs 6:10 (id: 120006010)

10A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,


## Proverbs 6:11 (id: 120006011)

11and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.


## Proverbs 6:12 (id: 120006012)

12A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,


## Proverbs 6:13 (id: 120006013)

13winking his eyes, speaking with his feet, and pointing with his fingers.


## Proverbs 6:14 (id: 120006014)

14With deceit in his heart he devises evil; he continually sows discord.


## Proverbs 6:15 (id: 120006015)

15Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery.


## Proverbs 6:16 (id: 120006016)

16There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to Him:


## Proverbs 6:17 (id: 120006017)

17haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,


## Proverbs 6:18 (id: 120006018)

18a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil,


## Proverbs 6:19 (id: 120006019)

19a false witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up discord among brothers.


## Proverbs 6:20 (id: 120006020)

20My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.


## Proverbs 6:21 (id: 120006021)

21Bind them always upon your heart; tie them around your neck.


## Proverbs 6:22 (id: 120006022)

22When you walk, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.


## Proverbs 6:23 (id: 120006023)

23For this commandment is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life,


## Proverbs 6:24 (id: 120006024)

24to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.


## Proverbs 6:25 (id: 120006025)

25Do not lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.


## Proverbs 6:26 (id: 120006026)

26For the levy of the prostitute is poverty, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.


## Proverbs 6:27 (id: 120006027)

27Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?


## Proverbs 6:28 (id: 120006028)

28Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?


## Proverbs 6:29 (id: 120006029)

29So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.


## Proverbs 6:30 (id: 120006030)

30Men do not despise the thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger.


## Proverbs 6:31 (id: 120006031)

31Yet if caught, he must pay sevenfold; he must give up all the wealth of his house.


## Proverbs 6:32 (id: 120006032)

32He who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.


## Proverbs 6:33 (id: 120006033)

33Wounds and dishonor will befall him, and his reproach will never be wiped away.


## Proverbs 6:34 (id: 120006034)

34For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance.


## Proverbs 6:35 (id: 120006035)

35He will not be appeased by any ransom, or persuaded by lavish gifts.


## Proverbs 7:1 (id: 120007001)

1My son, keep my words and treasure my commandments within you.


## Proverbs 7:2 (id: 120007002)

## Proverbs 7:6 (id: 120007006)
