## Romans 1:1 (id: 145001001)

1Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God—


## Romans 1:2 (id: 145001002)

2the gospel He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,


## Romans 1:3 (id: 145001003)

3regarding His Son, who was a descendant of David according to the flesh,


## Romans 1:4 (id: 145001004)

4and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by His resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.


## Romans 1:5 (id: 145001005)

5Through Him and on behalf of His name, we received grace and apostleship to call all those among the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.


## Romans 1:6 (id: 145001006)

6And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.


## Romans 1:7 (id: 145001007)

7To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


## Romans 1:8 (id: 145001008)

8First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed all over the world.


## Romans 1:9 (id: 145001009)

9God, whom I serve with my spirit in preaching the gospel of His Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you


## Romans 1:10 (id: 145001010)

10in my prayers at all times, asking that now at last by God’s will I may succeed in coming to you.


## Romans 1:11 (id: 145001011)

11For I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you,


## Romans 1:12 (id: 145001012)

12that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.


## Romans 1:13 (id: 145001013)

13I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, how often I planned to come to you (but have been prevented from visiting until now), in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.


## Romans 1:14 (id: 145001014)

14I am obligated both to Greeks and non\-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.


## Romans 1:15 (id: 145001015)

15That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.


## Romans 1:16 (id: 145001016)

16I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, then to the Greek.


## Romans 1:17 (id: 145001017)

17For the gospel reveals the righteousness of God that comes by faith from start to finish, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”


## Romans 1:18 (id: 145001018)

18The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness.


## Romans 1:19 (id: 145001019)

19For what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.


## Romans 1:20 (id: 145001020)

20For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood from His workmanship, so that men are without excuse.


## Romans 1:21 (id: 145001021)

21For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but they became futile in their thinking and darkened in their foolish hearts.


## Romans 1:22 (id: 145001022)

22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools,


## Romans 1:23 (id: 145001023)

23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images of mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.


## Romans 1:24 (id: 145001024)

24Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity for the dishonoring of their bodies with one another.


## Romans 1:25 (id: 145001025)

25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is forever worthy of praise! Amen.


## Romans 1:26 (id: 145001026)

26For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.


## Romans 1:27 (id: 145001027)

27Likewise, the men abandoned natural relations with women and burned with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.


## Romans 1:28 (id: 145001028)

28Furthermore, since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, He gave them up to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.


## Romans 1:29 (id: 145001029)

29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips,


## Romans 1:30 (id: 145001030)

30slanderers, God\-haters, insolent, arrogant, and boastful. They invent new forms of evil; they disobey their parents.


## Romans 1:31 (id: 145001031)

31They are senseless, faithless, heartless, merciless.


## Romans 1:32 (id: 145001032)

32Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things are worthy of death, they not only continue to do these things, but also approve of those who practice them.


## Romans 2:1 (id: 145002001)

1You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on another. For on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.


## Romans 2:2 (id: 145002002)

2And we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.


## Romans 2:3 (id: 145002003)

3So when you, O man, pass judgment on others, yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?


## Romans 2:4 (id: 145002004)

4Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?


## Romans 2:5 (id: 145002005)

5But because of your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.


## Romans 2:6 (id: 145002006)

6God “will repay each one according to his deeds.”


## Romans 2:7 (id: 145002007)

7To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.


## Romans 2:8 (id: 145002008)

8But for those who are self\-seeking and who reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and anger.


## Romans 2:9 (id: 145002009)

9There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the Greek;


## Romans 2:10 (id: 145002010)

10but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Greek.


## Romans 2:11 (id: 145002011)

11For God does not show favoritism.


## Romans 2:12 (id: 145002012)

12All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.


## Romans 2:13 (id: 145002013)

13For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be declared righteous.


## Romans 2:14 (id: 145002014)

14Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.


## Romans 2:15 (id: 145002015)

15So they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them


## Romans 2:16 (id: 145002016)

16on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ Jesus, as proclaimed by my gospel.


## Romans 2:17 (id: 145002017)

17Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;


## Romans 2:18 (id: 145002018)

18if you know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;


## Romans 2:19 (id: 145002019)

19if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness,


## Romans 2:20 (id: 145002020)

20an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—


## Romans 2:21 (id: 145002021)

21you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?


## Romans 2:22 (id: 145002022)

22You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?


## Romans 2:23 (id: 145002023)

23You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?


## Romans 2:24 (id: 145002024)

24As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”


## Romans 2:25 (id: 145002025)

25Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.


## Romans 2:26 (id: 145002026)

26If a man who is not circumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?


## Romans 2:27 (id: 145002027)

27The one who is physically uncircumcised yet keeps the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.


## Romans 2:28 (id: 145002028)

28A man is not a Jew because he is one outwardly, nor is circumcision only outward and physical.


## Romans 2:29 (id: 145002029)

29No, a man is a Jew because he is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise does not come from men, but from God.


## Romans 3:1 (id: 145003001)

1What, then, is the advantage of being a Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?


## Romans 3:2 (id: 145003002)

2Much in every way. First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.


## Romans 3:3 (id: 145003003)

3What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness?


## Romans 3:4 (id: 145003004)

4Certainly not! Let God be true and every man a liar. As it is written: “So that You may be proved right when You speak and victorious when You judge.”


## Romans 3:5 (id: 145003005)

5But if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict His wrath on us? I am speaking in human terms.


## Romans 3:6 (id: 145003006)

6Certainly not! In that case, how could God judge the world?


## Romans 3:7 (id: 145003007)

7However, if my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?


## Romans 3:8 (id: 145003008)

8Why not say, as some slanderously claim that we say, “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved!


## Romans 3:9 (id: 145003009)

9What then? Are we any better? Not at all. For we have already made the charge that Jews and Greeks alike are all under sin.


## Romans 3:10 (id: 145003010)

10As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one.


## Romans 3:11 (id: 145003011)

11There is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.


## Romans 3:12 (id: 145003012)

12All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”


## Romans 3:13 (id: 145003013)

13“Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The venom of vipers is on their lips.”


## Romans 3:14 (id: 145003014)

14“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”


## Romans 3:15 (id: 145003015)

15“Their feet are swift to shed blood;


## Romans 3:16 (id: 145003016)

16ruin and misery lie in their wake,


## Romans 3:17 (id: 145003017)

17and the way of peace they have not known.”


## Romans 3:18 (id: 145003018)

18“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”


## Romans 3:19 (id: 145003019)

19Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.


## Romans 3:20 (id: 145003020)

20Therefore no one will be justified in His sight by works of the law. For the law merely brings awareness of sin.


## Romans 3:21 (id: 145003021)

21But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, as attested by the Law and the Prophets.


## Romans 3:22 (id: 145003022)

22And this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction,


## Romans 3:23 (id: 145003023)

23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,


## Romans 3:24 (id: 145003024)

24and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.


## Romans 3:25 (id: 145003025)

25God presented Him as an atoning sacrifice in His blood through faith, in order to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance He had passed over the sins committed beforehand.


## Romans 3:26 (id: 145003026)

26He did this to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and to justify the one who has faith in Jesus.


## Romans 3:27 (id: 145003027)

27Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of works? No, but on that of faith.


## Romans 3:28 (id: 145003028)

28For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.


## Romans 3:29 (id: 145003029)

29Is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,


## Romans 3:30 (id: 145003030)

30since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.


## Romans 3:31 (id: 145003031)

31Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Certainly not! Instead, we uphold the law.


## Romans 4:1 (id: 145004001)

1What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has discovered?


## Romans 4:2 (id: 145004002)

2If Abraham was indeed justified by works, he had something to boast about, but not before God.


## Romans 4:3 (id: 145004003)

3For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”


## Romans 4:4 (id: 145004004)

4Now the wages of the worker are not credited as a gift, but as an obligation.


## Romans 4:5 (id: 145004005)

5However, to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.


## Romans 4:6 (id: 145004006)

6And David speaks likewise of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:


## Romans 4:7 (id: 145004007)

7“Blessed are they whose lawless acts are forgiven, whose sins are covered.


## Romans 4:8 (id: 145004008)

8Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.”


## Romans 4:9 (id: 145004009)

9Is this blessing only on the circumcised, or also on the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.


## Romans 4:10 (id: 145004010)

10In what context was it credited? Was it after his circumcision, or before? It was not after, but before.


## Romans 4:11 (id: 145004011)

11And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but are not circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.


## Romans 4:12 (id: 145004012)

12And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.


## Romans 4:13 (id: 145004013)

13For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world was not given through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.


## Romans 4:14 (id: 145004014)

14For if those who live by the law are heirs, faith is useless and the promise is worthless,


## Romans 4:15 (id: 145004015)

15because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law, there is no transgression.


## Romans 4:16 (id: 145004016)

16Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may rest on grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.


## Romans 4:17 (id: 145004017)

17As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the presence of God, in whom he believed, the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not yet exist.


## Romans 4:18 (id: 145004018)

18Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.”


## Romans 4:19 (id: 145004019)

19Without weakening in his faith, he acknowledged the decrepitness of his body (since he was about a hundred years old) and the lifelessness of Sarah’s womb.


## Romans 4:20 (id: 145004020)

20Yet he did not waver through disbelief in the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,


## Romans 4:21 (id: 145004021)

21being fully persuaded that God was able to do what He had promised.


## Romans 4:22 (id: 145004022)

22This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”


## Romans 4:23 (id: 145004023)

23Now the words “it was credited to him” were written not only for Abraham,


## Romans 4:24 (id: 145004024)

24but also for us, to whom righteousness will be credited—for us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.


## Romans 4:25 (id: 145004025)

25He was delivered over to death for our trespasses and was raised to life for our justification.


## Romans 5:1 (id: 145005001)

1Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,


## Romans 5:2 (id: 145005002)

2through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.


## Romans 5:3 (id: 145005003)

3Not only that, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;


## Romans 5:4 (id: 145005004)

4perseverance, character; and character, hope.


## Romans 5:5 (id: 145005005)

5And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us.


## Romans 5:6 (id: 145005006)

6For at just the right time, while we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.


## Romans 5:7 (id: 145005007)

7Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.


## Romans 5:8 (id: 145005008)

8But God proves His love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.


## Romans 5:9 (id: 145005009)

9Therefore, since we have now been justified by His blood, how much more shall we be saved from wrath through Him!


## Romans 5:10 (id: 145005010)

10For if, when we were enemies of God, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life!


## Romans 5:11 (id: 145005011)

11Not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.


## Romans 5:12 (id: 145005012)

12Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death was passed on to all men, because all sinned.


## Romans 5:13 (id: 145005013)

13For sin was in the world before the law was given; but sin is not taken into account when there is no law.


## Romans 5:14 (id: 145005014)

14Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who did not sin in the way that Adam transgressed. He is a pattern of the One to come.


## Romans 5:15 (id: 145005015)

15But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many!


## Romans 5:16 (id: 145005016)

16Again, the gift is not like the result of the one man’s sin: The judgment that followed one sin brought condemnation, but the gift that followed many trespasses brought justification.


## Romans 5:17 (id: 145005017)

17For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!


## Romans 5:18 (id: 145005018)

18So then, just as one trespass brought condemnation for all men, so also one act of righteousness brought justification and life for all men.


## Romans 5:19 (id: 145005019)

19For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.


## Romans 5:20 (id: 145005020)

20The law came in so that the trespass would increase; but where sin increased, grace increased all the more,


## Romans 5:21 (id: 145005021)

21so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.


## Romans 6:1 (id: 145006001)

1What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may increase?


## Romans 6:2 (id: 145006002)

2Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer?


## Romans 6:3 (id: 145006003)

3Or aren’t you aware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?


## Romans 6:4 (id: 145006004)

4We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life.


## Romans 6:5 (id: 145006005)

5For if we have been united with Him like this in His death, we will certainly also be united with Him in His resurrection.


## Romans 6:6 (id: 145006006)

6We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.


## Romans 6:7 (id: 145006007)

7For anyone who has died has been freed from sin.


## Romans 6:8 (id: 145006008)

8Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.


## Romans 6:9 (id: 145006009)

9For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, He cannot die again; death no longer has dominion over Him.


## Romans 6:10 (id: 145006010)

10The death He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life He lives, He lives to God.


## Romans 6:11 (id: 145006011)

11So you too must count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.


## Romans 6:12 (id: 145006012)

12Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires.


## Romans 6:13 (id: 145006013)

13Do not present the parts of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and present the parts of your body to Him as instruments of righteousness.


## Romans 6:14 (id: 145006014)

14For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.


## Romans 6:15 (id: 145006015)

15What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Certainly not!


## Romans 6:16 (id: 145006016)

16Do you not know that when you offer yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves to the one you obey, whether you are slaves to sin leading to death, or to obedience leading to righteousness?


## Romans 6:17 (id: 145006017)

17But thanks be to God that, though you once were slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were committed.


## Romans 6:18 (id: 145006018)

18You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.


## Romans 6:19 (id: 145006019)

19I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to escalating wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.


## Romans 6:20 (id: 145006020)

20For when you were slaves to sin, you were free of obligation to righteousness.


## Romans 6:21 (id: 145006021)

21What fruit did you reap at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The outcome of those things is death.


## Romans 6:22 (id: 145006022)

22But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the fruit you reap leads to holiness, and the outcome is eternal life.


## Romans 6:23 (id: 145006023)

23For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.


## Romans 7:1 (id: 145007001)

1Do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?


## Romans 7:2 (id: 145007002)

2For instance, a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.


## Romans 7:3 (id: 145007003)

3So then, if she is joined to another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.


## Romans 7:4 (id: 145007004)

4Therefore, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.


## Romans 7:5 (id: 145007005)

5For when we lived according to the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, bearing fruit for death.


## Romans 7:6 (id: 145007006)

6But now, having died to what bound us, we have been released from the law, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.


## Romans 7:7 (id: 145007007)

7What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the law. For I would not have been aware of coveting if the law had not said, “Do not covet.”


## Romans 7:8 (id: 145007008)

8But sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from the law, sin is dead.


## Romans 7:9 (id: 145007009)

9Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.


## Romans 7:10 (id: 145007010)

10So I discovered that the very commandment that was meant to bring life actually brought death.


## Romans 7:11 (id: 145007011)

11For sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through the commandment put me to death.


## Romans 7:12 (id: 145007012)

12So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.


## Romans 7:13 (id: 145007013)

13Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But in order that sin might be exposed as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.


## Romans 7:14 (id: 145007014)

14We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.


## Romans 7:15 (id: 145007015)

15I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do. But what I hate, I do.


## Romans 7:16 (id: 145007016)

16And if I do what I do not want to do, I admit that the law is good.


## Romans 7:17 (id: 145007017)

17In that case, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.


## Romans 7:18 (id: 145007018)

18I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh; for I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.


## Romans 7:19 (id: 145007019)

19For I do not do the good I want to do. Instead, I keep on doing the evil I do not want to do.


## Romans 7:20 (id: 145007020)

20And if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.


## Romans 7:21 (id: 145007021)

21So this is the principle I have discovered: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.


## Romans 7:22 (id: 145007022)

22For in my inner being I delight in God’s law.


## Romans 7:23 (id: 145007023)

23But I see another law at work in my body, warring against the law of my mind and holding me captive to the law of sin that dwells within me.


## Romans 7:24 (id: 145007024)

24What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?


## Romans 7:25 (id: 145007025)

25Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I serve the law of God, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.


## Romans 8:1 (id: 145008001)

1Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.


## Romans 8:2 (id: 145008002)

2For in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set you free from the law of sin and death.


## Romans 8:3 (id: 145008003)

3For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful man, as an offering for sin. He thus condemned sin in the flesh,


## Romans 8:4 (id: 145008004)

4so that the righteous standard of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.


## Romans 8:5 (id: 145008005)

5Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh; but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.


## Romans 8:6 (id: 145008006)

6The mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace,


## Romans 8:7 (id: 145008007)

7because the mind of the flesh is hostile to God: It does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.


## Romans 8:8 (id: 145008008)

8Those controlled by the flesh cannot please God.


## Romans 8:9 (id: 145008009)

9You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.


## Romans 8:10 (id: 145008010)

10But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.


## Romans 8:11 (id: 145008011)

11And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit, who lives in you.


## Romans 8:12 (id: 145008012)

12Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation, but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it.


## Romans 8:13 (id: 145008013)

13For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.


## Romans 8:14 (id: 145008014)

14For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.


## Romans 8:15 (id: 145008015)

15For you did not receive a spirit of slavery that returns you to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption to sonship, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!”


## Romans 8:16 (id: 145008016)

16The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.


## Romans 8:17 (id: 145008017)

17And if we are children, then we are heirs: heirs of God and co\-heirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with Him, so that we may also be glorified with Him.


## Romans 8:18 (id: 145008018)

18I consider that our present sufferings are not comparable to the glory that will be revealed in us.


## Romans 8:19 (id: 145008019)

19The creation waits in eager expectation for the revelation of the sons of God.


## Romans 8:20 (id: 145008020)

20For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will, but because of the One who subjected it, in hope


## Romans 8:21 (id: 145008021)

21that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.


## Romans 8:22 (id: 145008022)

22We know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until the present time.


## Romans 8:23 (id: 145008023)

23Not only that, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.


## Romans 8:24 (id: 145008024)

24For in this hope we were saved; but hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he can already see?


## Romans 8:25 (id: 145008025)

25But if we hope for what we do not yet see, we wait for it patiently.


## Romans 8:26 (id: 145008026)

26In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know how we ought to pray, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans too deep for words.


## Romans 8:27 (id: 145008027)

27And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.


## Romans 8:28 (id: 145008028)

28And we know that God works all things together for the good of those who love Him, who are called according to His purpose.


## Romans 8:29 (id: 145008029)

29For those God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers.


## Romans 8:30 (id: 145008030)

30And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified.


## Romans 8:31 (id: 145008031)

31What then shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?


## Romans 8:32 (id: 145008032)

32He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also, along with Him, freely give us all things?


## Romans 8:33 (id: 145008033)

33Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies.


## Romans 8:34 (id: 145008034)

34Who is there to condemn us? For Christ Jesus, who died, and more than that was raised to life, is at the right hand of God—and He is interceding for us.


## Romans 8:35 (id: 145008035)

35Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?


## Romans 8:36 (id: 145008036)

36As it is written: “For Your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”


## Romans 8:37 (id: 145008037)

37No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.


## Romans 8:38 (id: 145008038)

38For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,


## Romans 8:39 (id: 145008039)

39neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.


## Romans 9:1 (id: 145009001)

1I speak the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit.


## Romans 9:2 (id: 145009002)

2I have deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.


## Romans 9:3 (id: 145009003)

3For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood,


## Romans 9:4 (id: 145009004)

4the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory and the covenants; theirs the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.


## Romans 9:5 (id: 145009005)

5Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them proceeds the human descent of Christ, who is God over all, forever worthy of praise! Amen.


## Romans 9:6 (id: 145009006)

6It is not as though God’s word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.


## Romans 9:7 (id: 145009007)

7Nor because they are Abraham’s descendants are they all his children. On the contrary, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.”


## Romans 9:8 (id: 145009008)

8So it is not the children of the flesh who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as offspring.


## Romans 9:9 (id: 145009009)

9For this is what the promise stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”


## Romans 9:10 (id: 145009010)

10Not only that, but Rebecca’s children were conceived by one man, our father Isaac.


## Romans 9:11 (id: 145009011)

11Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God’s plan of election might stand,


## Romans 9:12 (id: 145009012)

12not by works but by Him who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”


## Romans 9:13 (id: 145009013)

13So it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”


## Romans 9:14 (id: 145009014)

14What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Certainly not!


## Romans 9:15 (id: 145009015)

15For He says to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”


## Romans 9:16 (id: 145009016)

16So then, it does not depend on man’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.


## Romans 9:17 (id: 145009017)

17For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”


## Romans 9:18 (id: 145009018)

18Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens whom He wants to harden.


## Romans 9:19 (id: 145009019)

19One of you will say to me, “Then why does God still find fault? For who can resist His will?”


## Romans 9:20 (id: 145009020)

20But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to Him who formed it, “Why did You make me like this?”


## Romans 9:21 (id: 145009021)

21Does not the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special occasions and another for common use?


## Romans 9:22 (id: 145009022)

22What if God, intending to show His wrath and make His power known, bore with great patience the vessels of His wrath, prepared for destruction?


## Romans 9:23 (id: 145009023)

23What if He did this to make the riches of His glory known to the vessels of His mercy, whom He prepared in advance for glory—


## Romans 9:24 (id: 145009024)

24including us, whom He has called not only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles?


## Romans 9:25 (id: 145009025)

25As He says in Hosea: “I will call them ‘My People’ who are not My people, and I will call her ‘My Beloved’ who is not My beloved,”


## Romans 9:26 (id: 145009026)

26and, “It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”


## Romans 9:27 (id: 145009027)

27Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites is like the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.


## Romans 9:28 (id: 145009028)

28For the Lord will carry out His sentence on the earth thoroughly and decisively.”


## Romans 9:29 (id: 145009029)

29It is just as Isaiah foretold: “Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have resembled Gomorrah.”


## Romans 9:30 (id: 145009030)

30What then will we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;


## Romans 9:31 (id: 145009031)

31but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.


## Romans 9:32 (id: 145009032)

32Why not? Because their pursuit was not by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,


## Romans 9:33 (id: 145009033)

33as it is written: “See, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense; and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”


## Romans 10:1 (id: 145010001)

1Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is for their salvation.


## Romans 10:2 (id: 145010002)

2For I testify about them that they are zealous for God, but not on the basis of knowledge.


## Romans 10:3 (id: 145010003)

3Because they were ignorant of God’s righteousness and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.


## Romans 10:4 (id: 145010004)

4For Christ is the end of the law, to bring righteousness to everyone who believes.


## Romans 10:5 (id: 145010005)

5For concerning the righteousness that is by the law, Moses writes: “The man who does these things will live by them.”


## Romans 10:6 (id: 145010006)

6But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down)


## Romans 10:7 (id: 145010007)

7or, ‘Who will descend into the Abyss?’ (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).”


## Romans 10:8 (id: 145010008)

8But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:


## Romans 10:9 (id: 145010009)

9that if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.


## Romans 10:10 (id: 145010010)

10For with your heart you believe and are justified, and with your mouth you confess and are saved.


## Romans 10:11 (id: 145010011)

11It is just as the Scripture says: “Anyone who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”


## Romans 10:12 (id: 145010012)

12For there is no difference between Jew and Greek: The same Lord is Lord of all, and gives richly to all who call on Him,


## Romans 10:13 (id: 145010013)

13for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”


## Romans 10:14 (id: 145010014)

14How then can they call on the One in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone to preach?


## Romans 10:15 (id: 145010015)

15And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”


## Romans 10:16 (id: 145010016)

16But not all of them welcomed the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”


## Romans 10:17 (id: 145010017)

17Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.


## Romans 10:18 (id: 145010018)

18But I ask, did they not hear? Indeed they did: “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”


## Romans 10:19 (id: 145010019)

19I ask instead, did Israel not understand? First, Moses says: “I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation without understanding.”


## Romans 10:20 (id: 145010020)

20And Isaiah boldly says: “I was found by those who did not seek Me; I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me.”


## Romans 10:21 (id: 145010021)

21But as for Israel he says: “All day long I have held out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.”


## Romans 11:1 (id: 145011001)

1I ask then, did God reject His people? Certainly not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.


## Romans 11:2 (id: 145011002)

2God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he appealed to God against Israel:


## Romans 11:3 (id: 145011003)

3“Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well”?


## Romans 11:4 (id: 145011004)

4And what was the divine reply to him? “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”


## Romans 11:5 (id: 145011005)

5In the same way, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.


## Romans 11:6 (id: 145011006)

6And if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.


## Romans 11:7 (id: 145011007)

7What then? What Israel was seeking, it failed to obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,


## Romans 11:8 (id: 145011008)

8as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear, to this very day.”


## Romans 11:9 (id: 145011009)

9And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution to them.


## Romans 11:10 (id: 145011010)

10May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.”


## Romans 11:11 (id: 145011011)

11I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Certainly not! However, because of their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous.


## Romans 11:12 (id: 145011012)

12But if their trespass means riches for the world, and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!


## Romans 11:13 (id: 145011013)

13I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry


## Romans 11:14 (id: 145011014)

14in the hope that I may provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.


## Romans 11:15 (id: 145011015)

15For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?


## Romans 11:16 (id: 145011016)

16If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch; if the root is holy, so are the branches.


## Romans 11:17 (id: 145011017)

17Now if some branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others to share in the nourishment of the olive root,


## Romans 11:18 (id: 145011018)

18do not boast over those branches. If you do, remember this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.


## Romans 11:19 (id: 145011019)

19You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”


## Romans 11:20 (id: 145011020)

20That is correct: They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.


## Romans 11:21 (id: 145011021)

21For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will certainly not spare you either.


## Romans 11:22 (id: 145011022)

22Take notice, therefore, of the kindness and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.


## Romans 11:23 (id: 145011023)

23And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.


## Romans 11:24 (id: 145011024)

24For if you were cut from a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into one that is cultivated, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!


## Romans 11:25 (id: 145011025)

25I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not be conceited: A hardening in part has come to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.


## Romans 11:26 (id: 145011026)

26And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will remove godlessness from Jacob.


## Romans 11:27 (id: 145011027)

27And this is My covenant with them when I take away their sins.”


## Romans 11:28 (id: 145011028)

28Regarding the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but regarding election, they are loved on account of the patriarchs.


## Romans 11:29 (id: 145011029)

29For God’s gifts and His call are irrevocable.


## Romans 11:30 (id: 145011030)

30Just as you who formerly disobeyed God have now received mercy through their disobedience,


## Romans 11:31 (id: 145011031)

31so they too have now disobeyed, in order that they too may now receive mercy through the mercy shown to you.


## Romans 11:32 (id: 145011032)

32For God has consigned everyone to disobedience so that He may have mercy on everyone.


## Romans 11:33 (id: 145011033)

33O, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and untraceable His ways!


## Romans 11:34 (id: 145011034)

34“Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?”


## Romans 11:35 (id: 145011035)

35“Who has first given to God, that God should repay him?”


## Romans 11:36 (id: 145011036)

36For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen.


## Romans 12:1 (id: 145012001)

1Therefore I urge you, brothers, on account of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.


## Romans 12:2 (id: 145012002)

2Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.


## Romans 12:3 (id: 145012003)

3For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but think of yourself with sober judgment, according to the measure of faith God has given you.


## Romans 12:4 (id: 145012004)

4Just as each of us has one body with many members, and not all members have the same function,


## Romans 12:5 (id: 145012005)

5so in Christ we who are many are one body, and each member belongs to one another.


## Romans 12:6 (id: 145012006)

6We have different gifts according to the grace given us. If one’s gift is prophecy, let him use it in proportion to his faith;


## Romans 12:7 (id: 145012007)

7if it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach;


## Romans 12:8 (id: 145012008)

8if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is giving, let him give generously; if it is leading, let him lead with diligence; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.


## Romans 12:9 (id: 145012009)

9Love must be sincere. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good.


## Romans 12:10 (id: 145012010)

10Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Outdo yourselves in honoring one another.


## Romans 12:11 (id: 145012011)

11Do not let your zeal subside; keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.


## Romans 12:12 (id: 145012012)

12Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, persistent in prayer.


## Romans 12:13 (id: 145012013)

13Share with the saints who are in need. Practice hospitality.


## Romans 12:14 (id: 145012014)

14Bless those who persecute you. Bless and do not curse.


## Romans 12:15 (id: 145012015)

15Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.


## Romans 12:16 (id: 145012016)

16Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but associate with the lowly. Do not be conceited.


## Romans 12:17 (id: 145012017)

17Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Carefully consider what is right in the eyes of everybody.


## Romans 12:18 (id: 145012018)

18If it is possible on your part, live at peace with everyone.


## Romans 12:19 (id: 145012019)

19Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but leave room for God’s wrath. For it is written: “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord.”


## Romans 12:20 (id: 145012020)

20On the contrary, “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink. For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head.”


## Romans 12:21 (id: 145012021)

21Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.


## Romans 13:1 (id: 145013001)

1Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which is from God. The authorities that exist have been appointed by God.


## Romans 13:2 (id: 145013002)

2Consequently, whoever resists authority is opposing what God has set in place, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.


## Romans 13:3 (id: 145013003)

3For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be unafraid of the one in authority? Then do what is right, and you will have his approval.


## Romans 13:4 (id: 145013004)

4For he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not carry the sword in vain. He is God’s servant, an agent of retribution to the wrongdoer.


## Romans 13:5 (id: 145013005)

5Therefore it is necessary to submit to authority, not only to avoid punishment, but also as a matter of conscience.


## Romans 13:6 (id: 145013006)

6This is also why you pay taxes. For the authorities are God’s servants, who devote themselves to their work.


## Romans 13:7 (id: 145013007)

7Pay everyone what you owe him: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.


## Romans 13:8 (id: 145013008)

8Be indebted to no one, except to one another in love. For he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.


## Romans 13:9 (id: 145013009)

9The commandments “Do not commit adultery,” “Do not murder,” “Do not steal,” “Do not covet,” and any other commandments, are summed up in this one decree: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”


## Romans 13:10 (id: 145013010)

10Love does no wrong to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.


## Romans 13:11 (id: 145013011)

11And do this, understanding the occasion. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.


## Romans 13:12 (id: 145013012)

12The night is nearly over; the day has drawn near. So let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.


## Romans 13:13 (id: 145013013)

13Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.


## Romans 13:14 (id: 145013014)

14Instead, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the desires of the flesh.


## Romans 14:1 (id: 145014001)

1Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on his opinions.


## Romans 14:2 (id: 145014002)

2For one person has faith to eat all things, while another, who is weak, eats only vegetables.


## Romans 14:3 (id: 145014003)

3The one who eats everything must not belittle the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted him.


## Romans 14:4 (id: 145014004)

4Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.


## Romans 14:5 (id: 145014005)

5One person regards a certain day above the others, while someone else considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.


## Romans 14:6 (id: 145014006)

6He who observes a special day does so to the Lord; he who eats does so to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.


## Romans 14:7 (id: 145014007)

7For none of us lives to himself alone, and none of us dies to himself alone.


## Romans 14:8 (id: 145014008)

8If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.


## Romans 14:9 (id: 145014009)

9For this reason Christ died and returned to life, that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.


## Romans 14:10 (id: 145014010)

10Why, then, do you judge your brother? Or why do you belittle your brother? For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat.


## Romans 14:11 (id: 145014011)

11It is written: “As surely as I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow before Me; every tongue will confess to God.”


## Romans 14:12 (id: 145014012)

12So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.


## Romans 14:13 (id: 145014013)

13Therefore let us stop judging one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother’s way.


## Romans 14:14 (id: 145014014)

14I am convinced and fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.


## Romans 14:15 (id: 145014015)

15If your brother is distressed by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother, for whom Christ died.


## Romans 14:16 (id: 145014016)

16Do not allow what you consider good, then, to be spoken of as evil.


## Romans 14:17 (id: 145014017)

17For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.


## Romans 14:18 (id: 145014018)

18For whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.


## Romans 14:19 (id: 145014019)

19So then, let us pursue what leads to peace and to mutual edification.


## Romans 14:20 (id: 145014020)

20Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to let his eating be a stumbling block.


## Romans 14:21 (id: 145014021)

21It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything to cause your brother to stumble.


## Romans 14:22 (id: 145014022)

22Keep your belief about such matters between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.


## Romans 14:23 (id: 145014023)

23But the one who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that is not from faith is sin.


## Romans 15:1 (id: 145015001)

1We who are strong ought to bear with the shortcomings of the weak and not to please ourselves.


## Romans 15:2 (id: 145015002)

2Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.


## Romans 15:3 (id: 145015003)

3For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written: “The insults of those who insult You have fallen on Me.”


## Romans 15:4 (id: 145015004)

4For everything that was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.


## Romans 15:5 (id: 145015005)

5Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you harmony with one another in Christ Jesus,


## Romans 15:6 (id: 145015006)

6so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.


## Romans 15:7 (id: 145015007)

7Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring glory to God.


## Romans 15:8 (id: 145015008)

8For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God’s truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,


## Romans 15:9 (id: 145015009)

9so that the Gentiles may glorify God for His mercy. As it is written: “Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles; I will sing hymns to Your name.”


## Romans 15:10 (id: 145015010)

10Again, it says: “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.”


## Romans 15:11 (id: 145015011)

11And again: “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and extol Him, all you peoples.”


## Romans 15:12 (id: 145015012)

12And once more, Isaiah says: “The Root of Jesse will appear, One who will arise to rule over the Gentiles; in Him the Gentiles will put their hope.”


## Romans 15:13 (id: 145015013)

13Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.


## Romans 15:14 (id: 145015014)

14I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, brimming with knowledge, and able to instruct one another.


## Romans 15:15 (id: 145015015)

15However, I have written you a bold reminder on some points, because of the grace God has given me


## Romans 15:16 (id: 145015016)

16to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.


## Romans 15:17 (id: 145015017)

17Therefore I exult in Christ Jesus in my service to God.


## Romans 15:18 (id: 145015018)

18I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed,


## Romans 15:19 (id: 145015019)

19by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.


## Romans 15:20 (id: 145015020)

20In this way I have aspired to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation.


## Romans 15:21 (id: 145015021)

21Rather, as it is written: “Those who were not told about Him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”


## Romans 15:22 (id: 145015022)

22That is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.


## Romans 15:23 (id: 145015023)

23But now that there are no further opportunities for me in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to visit you,


## Romans 15:24 (id: 145015024)

24I hope to see you on my way to Spain. And after I have enjoyed your company for a while, you can equip me for my journey.


## Romans 15:25 (id: 145015025)

25Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem to serve the saints there.


## Romans 15:26 (id: 145015026)

26For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.


## Romans 15:27 (id: 145015027)

27They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are obligated to minister to them with material blessings.


## Romans 15:28 (id: 145015028)

28So after I have completed this service and have safely delivered this bounty to them, I will set off to Spain by way of you.


## Romans 15:29 (id: 145015029)

29I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.


## Romans 15:30 (id: 145015030)

30Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.


## Romans 15:31 (id: 145015031)

31Pray that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there,


## Romans 15:32 (id: 145015032)

32so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.


## Romans 15:33 (id: 145015033)

33The God of peace be with all of you. Amen.


## Romans 16:1 (id: 145016001)

1I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchrea.


## Romans 16:2 (id: 145016002)

2Welcome her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and assist her with anything she may need from you. For she has been a great help to many people, including me.


## Romans 16:3 (id: 145016003)

3Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,


## Romans 16:4 (id: 145016004)

4who have risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.


## Romans 16:5 (id: 145016005)

5Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my beloved Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.


## Romans 16:6 (id: 145016006)

6Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you.


## Romans 16:7 (id: 145016007)

7Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow countrymen and fellow prisoners. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.


## Romans 16:8 (id: 145016008)

8Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.


## Romans 16:9 (id: 145016009)

9Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my beloved Stachys.


## Romans 16:10 (id: 145016010)

10Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.


## Romans 16:11 (id: 145016011)

11Greet Herodion, my fellow countryman. Greet those from the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.


## Romans 16:12 (id: 145016012)

12Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, women who have worked hard in the Lord. Greet my beloved Persis, who has worked very hard in the Lord.


## Romans 16:13 (id: 145016013)

13Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me as well.


## Romans 16:14 (id: 145016014)

14Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with them.


## Romans 16:15 (id: 145016015)

15Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the saints with them.


## Romans 16:16 (id: 145016016)

16Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send you greetings.


## Romans 16:17 (id: 145016017)

17Now I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Turn away from them.


## Romans 16:18 (id: 145016018)

18For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.


## Romans 16:19 (id: 145016019)

19Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil.


## Romans 16:20 (id: 145016020)

20The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.


## Romans 16:21 (id: 145016021)

21Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you greetings, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow countrymen.


## Romans 16:22 (id: 145016022)

22I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.


## Romans 16:23 (id: 145016023)

23Gaius, who has hosted me and all the church, sends you greetings. Erastus, the city treasurer, sends you greetings, as does our brother Quartus.


## Romans 16:25 (id: 145016025)

25Now to Him who is able to strengthen you by my gospel and by the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery concealed for ages past


## Romans 16:26 (id: 145016026)

26but now revealed and made known through the writings of the prophets by the command of the eternal God, in order to lead all nations to the obedience that comes from faith—


## Romans 16:27 (id: 145016027)

27to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
