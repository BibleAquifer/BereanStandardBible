## Philemon 1:1 (id: 157001001)

1Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker,


## Philemon 1:2 (id: 157001002)

2to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets at your house:


## Philemon 1:3 (id: 157001003)

3Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


## Philemon 1:4 (id: 157001004)

4I always thank my God, remembering you in my prayers,


## Philemon 1:5 (id: 157001005)

5because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.


## Philemon 1:6 (id: 157001006)

6I pray that your partnership in the faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every good thing that is ours in Christ.


## Philemon 1:7 (id: 157001007)

7I take great joy and encouragement in your love, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.


## Philemon 1:8 (id: 157001008)

8So although in Christ I am bold enough to order you to do what is proper,


## Philemon 1:9 (id: 157001009)

9I prefer to appeal on the basis of love. For I, Paul, am now aged, and a prisoner of Christ Jesus as well.


## Philemon 1:10 (id: 157001010)

10I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whose father I became while I was in chains.


## Philemon 1:11 (id: 157001011)

11Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.


## Philemon 1:12 (id: 157001012)

12I am sending back to you him who is my very heart.


## Philemon 1:13 (id: 157001013)

13I would have liked to keep him with me, so that on your behalf he could minister to me in my chains for the gospel.


## Philemon 1:14 (id: 157001014)

14But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness will not be out of compulsion, but by your own free will.


## Philemon 1:15 (id: 157001015)

15For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back for good—


## Philemon 1:16 (id: 157001016)

16no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother. He is especially beloved to me, but even more so to you, both in person and in the Lord.


## Philemon 1:17 (id: 157001017)

17So if you consider me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.


## Philemon 1:18 (id: 157001018)

18But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.


## Philemon 1:19 (id: 157001019)

19I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it—not to mention that you owe me your very self.


## Philemon 1:20 (id: 157001020)

20Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.


## Philemon 1:21 (id: 157001021)

21Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.


## Philemon 1:22 (id: 157001022)

22In the meantime, prepare a guest room for me, because I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.


## Philemon 1:23 (id: 157001023)

23Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings,


## Philemon 1:24 (id: 157001024)

24as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.


## Philemon 1:25 (id: 157001025)

25The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
