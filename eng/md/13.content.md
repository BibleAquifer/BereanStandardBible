14But Eleazar and David stationed themselves in the middle of the field and defended it. They struck down the Philistines, and the LORD brought about a great victory.

15Three of the thirty chief men went down to David, to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.

## 1 Chronicles 11:18 (id: 113011018)

## 1 Chronicles 11:19 (id: 113011019)

19saying, “Far be it from me, my God, to do this! How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” Because they had brought it at the risk of their lives, David refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.


## 1 Chronicles 11:20 (id: 113011020)

20Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the Three, and he wielded his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name along with the Three.

22And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a man of valor from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. He struck down two champions of Moab, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion.


## 1 Chronicles 11:23 (id: 113011023)

23He also struck down an Egyptian, a huge man five cubits tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club, snatched the spear from his hand, and killed the Egyptian with his own spear.


## 1 Chronicles 11:24 (id: 113011024)

24These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who won a name along with the three mighty men.


## 1 Chronicles 11:25 (id: 113011025)

25He was most honored among the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. And David appointed him over his guard.


## 1 Chronicles 11:26 (id: 113011026)

26Now these were the mighty men: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

47Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.


## 1 Chronicles 12:1 (id: 113012001)

1Now these were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was still banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the mighty men who helped him in battle;


## 1 Chronicles 12:2 (id: 113012002)

2they were archers using both the right and left hands to sling stones and shoot arrows; and they were Saul’s kinsmen from Benjamin):


## 1 Chronicles 12:3 (id: 113012003)

3Ahiezer their chief and Joash, who were the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite;


## 1 Chronicles 12:4 (id: 113012004)

4Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the Thirty and a leader over the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite;


## 1 Chronicles 12:5 (id: 113012005)

5Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite;


## 1 Chronicles 12:6 (id: 113012006)

6Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites;


## 1 Chronicles 12:7 (id: 113012007)

7and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.


## 1 Chronicles 12:8 (id: 113012008)

8Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the wilderness. They were mighty men of valor, trained for battle, experts with the shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions and who were as swift as gazelles on the mountains:


## 1 Chronicles 12:9 (id: 113012009)

9Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,


## 1 Chronicles 12:10 (id: 113012010)

10Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,


## 1 Chronicles 12:11 (id: 113012011)

11Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,


## 1 Chronicles 12:12 (id: 113012012)

12Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,


## 1 Chronicles 12:13 (id: 113012013)

13Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh.


## 1 Chronicles 12:14 (id: 113012014)

14These Gadites were army commanders, the least of whom was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.


## 1 Chronicles 12:15 (id: 113012015)

15These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight all those in the valleys, both to the east and to the west.


## 1 Chronicles 12:16 (id: 113012016)

16Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.


## 1 Chronicles 12:17 (id: 113012017)

17And David went out to meet them, saying, “If you have come to me in peace to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free of violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you.”


## 1 Chronicles 12:18 (id: 113012018)

18Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the Thirty, and he said: “We are yours, O David! We are with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers, for your God helps you.” So David received them and made them leaders of his troops.


## 1 Chronicles 12:19 (id: 113012019)

19Some from Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (They did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers consulted and sent David away, saying, “It will cost us our heads if he defects to his master Saul.”)


## 1 Chronicles 12:20 (id: 113012020)

20When David went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.


## 1 Chronicles 12:21 (id: 113012021)

21They helped David against the raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and commanders in the army.


## 1 Chronicles 12:22 (id: 113012022)

22For at that time men came to David day after day to help him, until he had a great army, like the army of God.


## 1 Chronicles 12:23 (id: 113012023)

23Now these are the numbers of men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, in accordance with the word of the LORD:


## 1 Chronicles 12:24 (id: 113012024)

24From Judah: 6,800 armed troops bearing shields and spears.


## 1 Chronicles 12:25 (id: 113012025)

25From Simeon: 7,100 mighty men of valor, ready for battle.


## 1 Chronicles 12:26 (id: 113012026)

26From Levi: 4,600,


## 1 Chronicles 12:27 (id: 113012027)

27including Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, with 3,700 men,


## 1 Chronicles 12:28 (id: 113012028)

28and Zadok, a mighty young man of valor, with 22 commanders from his own family.


## 1 Chronicles 12:29 (id: 113012029)

29From Benjamin, the kinsmen of Saul: 3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to the house of Saul up to that time.


## 1 Chronicles 12:30 (id: 113012030)

30From Ephraim: 20,800 mighty men of valor, famous among their own clans.


## 1 Chronicles 12:31 (id: 113012031)

31From the half\-tribe of Manasseh: 18,000 designated by name to come and make David king.


## 1 Chronicles 12:32 (id: 113012032)

32From Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do: 200 chiefs with all their kinsmen at their command.


## 1 Chronicles 12:33 (id: 113012033)

33From Zebulun: 50,000 fit for service, trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war, who with one purpose were devoted to David.


## 1 Chronicles 12:34 (id: 113012034)

34From Naphtali: 1,000 commanders, accompanied by 37,000 men with shield and spear.


## 1 Chronicles 12:35 (id: 113012035)

35From Dan: 28,600 prepared for battle.


## 1 Chronicles 12:36 (id: 113012036)

36From Asher: 40,000 fit for service, prepared for battle.


## 1 Chronicles 12:37 (id: 113012037)

37And from east of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh there: 120,000 armed with every kind of weapon of war.


## 1 Chronicles 12:38 (id: 113012038)

38All these men of war, arrayed for battle, came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. And all the rest of the Israelites were of one mind to make David king.


## 1 Chronicles 12:39 (id: 113012039)

39They spent three days there eating and drinking with David, for their relatives had provided for them.


## 1 Chronicles 12:40 (id: 113012040)

40And their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—abundant supplies of flour, fig cakes and raisin cakes, wine and oil, oxen and sheep. Indeed, there was joy in Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 13:1 (id: 113013001)

1Then David conferred with all his leaders, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds.


## 1 Chronicles 13:2 (id: 113013002)

2And he said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if this is of the LORD our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers in all the land of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites in their cities and pasturelands, so that they may join us.


## 1 Chronicles 13:3 (id: 113013003)

3Then let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of Him in the days of Saul.”


## 1 Chronicles 13:4 (id: 113013004)

4And because this proposal seemed right to all the people, the whole assembly agreed to it.


## 1 Chronicles 13:5 (id: 113013005)

5So David assembled all Israel, from the River Shihor in Egypt to Lebo\-hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath\-jearim.


## 1 Chronicles 13:6 (id: 113013006)

6David and all Israel went up to Baalah of Judah (that is, Kiriath\-jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is called by the Name.


## 1 Chronicles 13:7 (id: 113013007)

7So they carried the ark of God from the house of Abinadab on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding the cart.


## 1 Chronicles 13:8 (id: 113013008)

8David and all the Israelites were celebrating before God with all their might, with songs and on harps and lyres, with tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.


## 1 Chronicles 13:9 (id: 113013009)

9When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark, because the oxen had stumbled.


## 1 Chronicles 13:10 (id: 113013010)

10And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and He struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.


## 1 Chronicles 13:11 (id: 113013011)

11Then David became angry because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah. So he named that place Perez\-uzzah, as it is called to this day.


## 1 Chronicles 13:12 (id: 113013012)

12That day David feared God and asked, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?”


## 1 Chronicles 13:13 (id: 113013013)

13So he did not move the ark with him to the City of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed\-edom the Gittite.


## 1 Chronicles 13:14 (id: 113013014)

14Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed\-edom in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his household and everything he owned.


## 1 Chronicles 14:1 (id: 113014001)

1Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters, to build a palace for him.


## 1 Chronicles 14:2 (id: 113014002)

2And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had highly exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 14:3 (id: 113014003)

3And David took more wives in Jerusalem and became the father of more sons and daughters.


## 1 Chronicles 14:4 (id: 113014004)

4These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,


## 1 Chronicles 14:5 (id: 113014005)

5Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,


## 1 Chronicles 14:6 (id: 113014006)

6Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,


## 1 Chronicles 14:7 (id: 113014007)

7Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.


## 1 Chronicles 14:8 (id: 113014008)

8When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went out to face them.


## 1 Chronicles 14:9 (id: 113014009)

9Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim.


## 1 Chronicles 14:10 (id: 113014010)

10So David inquired of God, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” “Go,” replied the LORD, “for I will deliver them into your hand.”


## 1 Chronicles 14:11 (id: 113014011)

11So David and his men went up to Baal\-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, God has burst out against my enemies by my hand.” So they called that place Baal\-perazim.


## 1 Chronicles 14:12 (id: 113014012)

12There the Philistines abandoned their gods, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire.


## 1 Chronicles 14:13 (id: 113014013)

13Once again the Philistines raided the valley.


## 1 Chronicles 14:14 (id: 113014014)

14So David again inquired of God, who answered him, “Do not march up after them, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.


## 1 Chronicles 14:15 (id: 113014015)

15As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle, because this will mean that God has gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”


## 1 Chronicles 14:16 (id: 113014016)

16So David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.


## 1 Chronicles 14:17 (id: 113014017)

17And David’s fame went out into every land, and the LORD caused all nations to fear him.


## 1 Chronicles 15:1 (id: 113015001)

1David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.


## 1 Chronicles 15:2 (id: 113015002)

2Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD has chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before Him forever.”


## 1 Chronicles 15:3 (id: 113015003)

3And David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.


## 1 Chronicles 15:4 (id: 113015004)

4Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:


## 1 Chronicles 15:5 (id: 113015005)

5From the Kohathites, Uriel the chief and 120 of his relatives;


## 1 Chronicles 15:6 (id: 113015006)

6from the Merarites, Asaiah the chief and 220 of his relatives;


## 1 Chronicles 15:7 (id: 113015007)

7from the Gershomites, Joel the chief and 130 of his relatives;


## 1 Chronicles 15:8 (id: 113015008)

8from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the chief and 200 of his relatives;


## 1 Chronicles 15:9 (id: 113015009)

9from the Hebronites, Eliel the chief and 80 of his relatives;


## 1 Chronicles 15:10 (id: 113015010)

10and from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the chief and 112 of his relatives.


## 1 Chronicles 15:11 (id: 113015011)

11David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.


## 1 Chronicles 15:12 (id: 113015012)

12And he said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves so that you may bring the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.


## 1 Chronicles 15:13 (id: 113015013)

13It was because you Levites were not with us the first time that the LORD our God burst forth in anger against us. For we did not consult Him about the proper order.”


## 1 Chronicles 15:14 (id: 113015014)

14So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 15:15 (id: 113015015)

15And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the LORD.


## 1 Chronicles 15:16 (id: 113015016)

16David also told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers to lift up their voices with joy, accompanied by musical instruments—harps, lyres, and cymbals.


## 1 Chronicles 15:17 (id: 113015017)

17So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah; from their brothers the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah;


## 1 Chronicles 15:18 (id: 113015018)

18and with them their brothers next in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed\-edom and Jeiel.


## 1 Chronicles 15:19 (id: 113015019)

19The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals.


## 1 Chronicles 15:20 (id: 113015020)

20Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to Alamoth.


## 1 Chronicles 15:21 (id: 113015021)

21And Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed\-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to Sheminith.


## 1 Chronicles 15:22 (id: 113015022)

22Chenaniah the head Levite was the director of the music because he was highly skilled.


## 1 Chronicles 15:23 (id: 113015023)

23Berechiah and Elkanah were to be guardians of the ark.


## 1 Chronicles 15:24 (id: 113015024)

24Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer—the priests—were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed\-edom and Jehiah were also to be guardians of the ark.


## 1 Chronicles 15:25 (id: 113015025)

25So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands went with rejoicing to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed\-edom.


## 1 Chronicles 15:26 (id: 113015026)

26And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.


## 1 Chronicles 15:27 (id: 113015027)

27Now David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the director of music for the singers. David also wore a linen ephod.


## 1 Chronicles 15:28 (id: 113015028)

28So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, with the sounding of rams’ horns and trumpets, and with cymbals and the music of harps and lyres.


## 1 Chronicles 15:29 (id: 113015029)

29As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was entering the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.


## 1 Chronicles 16:1 (id: 113016001)

1So they brought the ark of God and placed it inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.


## 1 Chronicles 16:2 (id: 113016002)

2When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.


## 1 Chronicles 16:3 (id: 113016003)

3Then he distributed to every man and woman of Israel a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.


## 1 Chronicles 16:4 (id: 113016004)

4David appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, to celebrate, to give thanks, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 16:5 (id: 113016005)

5Asaph was the chief, Zechariah was second, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed\-edom, and Jeiel. They were to play the harps and lyres, while Asaph sounded the cymbals


## 1 Chronicles 16:6 (id: 113016006)

6and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.


## 1 Chronicles 16:7 (id: 113016007)

7On that day David first committed to Asaph and his associates this song of thanksgiving to the LORD:


## 1 Chronicles 16:8 (id: 113016008)

8“Give thanks to the LORD; call upon His name; make known His deeds among the nations.


## 1 Chronicles 16:9 (id: 113016009)

9Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.


## 1 Chronicles 16:10 (id: 113016010)

10Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.


## 1 Chronicles 16:11 (id: 113016011)

11Seek out the LORD and His strength; seek His face always.


## 1 Chronicles 16:12 (id: 113016012)

12Remember the wonders He has done, His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,


## 1 Chronicles 16:13 (id: 113016013)

13O offspring of His servant Israel, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.


## 1 Chronicles 16:14 (id: 113016014)

14He is the LORD our God; His judgments carry throughout the earth.


## 1 Chronicles 16:15 (id: 113016015)

15Remember His covenant forever, the word He ordained for a thousand generations—


## 1 Chronicles 16:16 (id: 113016016)

16the covenant He made with Abraham, and the oath He swore to Isaac.


## 1 Chronicles 16:17 (id: 113016017)

17He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:


## 1 Chronicles 16:18 (id: 113016018)

18‘I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.’


## 1 Chronicles 16:19 (id: 113016019)

19When they were few in number, few indeed, and strangers in the land,


## 1 Chronicles 16:20 (id: 113016020)

20they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.


## 1 Chronicles 16:21 (id: 113016021)

21He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:


## 1 Chronicles 16:22 (id: 113016022)

22‘Do not touch My anointed ones! Do no harm to My prophets!’


## 1 Chronicles 16:23 (id: 113016023)

23Sing to the LORD, all the earth. Proclaim His salvation day after day.


## 1 Chronicles 16:24 (id: 113016024)

24Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.


## 1 Chronicles 16:25 (id: 113016025)

25For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.


## 1 Chronicles 16:26 (id: 113016026)

26For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is the LORD who made the heavens.


## 1 Chronicles 16:27 (id: 113016027)

27Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and joy fill His dwelling.


## 1 Chronicles 16:28 (id: 113016028)

28Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.


## 1 Chronicles 16:29 (id: 113016029)

29Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and come before Him. Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness;


## 1 Chronicles 16:30 (id: 113016030)

30tremble before Him, all the earth. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.


## 1 Chronicles 16:31 (id: 113016031)

31Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice. Let them say among the nations, ‘The LORD reigns!’


## 1 Chronicles 16:32 (id: 113016032)

32Let the sea resound, and all that fills it; let the fields exult, and all that is in them.


## 1 Chronicles 16:33 (id: 113016033)

33Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD, for He is coming to judge the earth.


## 1 Chronicles 16:34 (id: 113016034)

34Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.


## 1 Chronicles 16:35 (id: 113016035)

35Then cry out: ‘Save us, O God of our salvation; gather and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise.’


## 1 Chronicles 16:36 (id: 113016036)

36Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.” Then all the people said, “Amen!” and “Praise the LORD!”


## 1 Chronicles 16:37 (id: 113016037)

37So David left Asaph and his associates there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to minister there regularly according to the daily requirements,


## 1 Chronicles 16:38 (id: 113016038)

38along with Obed\-edom and his sixty\-eight relatives. Obed\-edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were to be gatekeepers.


## 1 Chronicles 16:39 (id: 113016039)

39And David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon


## 1 Chronicles 16:40 (id: 113016040)

40to regularly present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offerings, morning and evening, according to all that was written in the Law of the LORD, which He had commanded Israel to keep.


## 1 Chronicles 16:41 (id: 113016041)

41With them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD, for “His loving devotion endures forever.”


## 1 Chronicles 16:42 (id: 113016042)

42Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for the songs of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.


## 1 Chronicles 16:43 (id: 113016043)

43Then all the people departed for their homes, and David returned home to bless his household.


## 1 Chronicles 17:1 (id: 113017001)

1After David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent.”


## 1 Chronicles 17:2 (id: 113017002)

2And Nathan replied to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”


## 1 Chronicles 17:3 (id: 113017003)

3But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,


## 1 Chronicles 17:4 (id: 113017004)

4“Go and tell My servant David that this is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build Me a house in which to dwell.


## 1 Chronicles 17:5 (id: 113017005)

5For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt until this day, but I have moved from tent to tent and dwelling to dwelling.


## 1 Chronicles 17:6 (id: 113017006)

6In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My people, ‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’


## 1 Chronicles 17:7 (id: 113017007)

7Now then, you are to tell My servant David that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 17:8 (id: 113017008)

8I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like that of the greatest in the land.


## 1 Chronicles 17:9 (id: 113017009)

9And I will provide a place for My people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them as they did at the beginning


## 1 Chronicles 17:10 (id: 113017010)

10and have done since the day I appointed judges over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you.


## 1 Chronicles 17:11 (id: 113017011)

11And when your days are fulfilled and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.


## 1 Chronicles 17:12 (id: 113017012)

12He will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever.


## 1 Chronicles 17:13 (id: 113017013)

13I will be his Father, and he will be My son. And I will never remove My loving devotion from him as I removed it from your predecessor.


## 1 Chronicles 17:14 (id: 113017014)

14But I will set him over My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.”


## 1 Chronicles 17:15 (id: 113017015)

15So Nathan relayed to David all the words of this entire revelation.


## 1 Chronicles 17:16 (id: 113017016)

16Then King David went in, sat before the LORD, and said, “Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far?


## 1 Chronicles 17:17 (id: 113017017)

17And as if this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God, You have spoken about the future of the house of Your servant and have regarded me as a man of great distinction, O LORD God.


## 1 Chronicles 17:18 (id: 113017018)

18What more can David say to You for honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant,


## 1 Chronicles 17:19 (id: 113017019)

19O LORD. For the sake of Your servant and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this great thing and made known all these great promises.


## 1 Chronicles 17:20 (id: 113017020)

20O LORD, there is none like You, and there is no God but You, according to everything we have heard with our own ears.


## 1 Chronicles 17:21 (id: 113017021)

21And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself? You made a name for Yourself through great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed from Egypt.


## 1 Chronicles 17:22 (id: 113017022)

22For You have made Your people Israel Your very own forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God.


## 1 Chronicles 17:23 (id: 113017023)

23And now, O LORD, let the word You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house be established forever. Do as You have promised,


## 1 Chronicles 17:24 (id: 113017024)

24so that Your name will be established and magnified forever when it is said, ‘The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, is God over Israel.’ And may the house of Your servant David be established before You.


## 1 Chronicles 17:25 (id: 113017025)

25For You, my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build a house for him. Therefore Your servant has found the courage to pray before You.


## 1 Chronicles 17:26 (id: 113017026)

26And now, O LORD, You are God! And You have promised this goodness to Your servant.


## 1 Chronicles 17:27 (id: 113017027)

27So now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever.”


## 1 Chronicles 18:1 (id: 113018001)

1Some time later, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its villages from the hand of the Philistines.


## 1 Chronicles 18:2 (id: 113018002)

2David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to David and brought him tribute.


## 1 Chronicles 18:3 (id: 113018003)

3As far as Hamath, David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah, who had marched out to establish his dominion along the Euphrates River.


## 1 Chronicles 18:4 (id: 113018004)

4David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers, and he hamstrung all the horses except a hundred he kept for the chariots.


## 1 Chronicles 18:5 (id: 113018005)

5When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down twenty\-two thousand of their men.


## 1 Chronicles 18:6 (id: 113018006)

6Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.


## 1 Chronicles 18:7 (id: 113018007)

7And David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 18:8 (id: 113018008)

8And from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars, and various bronze articles.


## 1 Chronicles 18:9 (id: 113018009)

9When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,


## 1 Chronicles 18:10 (id: 113018010)

10he sent his son Hadoram to greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze,


## 1 Chronicles 18:11 (id: 113018011)

11and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had carried off from all these nations—from Edom and Moab, and from the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalekites.


## 1 Chronicles 18:12 (id: 113018012)

12Moreover, Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.


## 1 Chronicles 18:13 (id: 113018013)

13He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.


## 1 Chronicles 18:14 (id: 113018014)

14Thus David reigned over all Israel and administered justice and righteousness for all his people:


## 1 Chronicles 18:15 (id: 113018015)

15Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;


## 1 Chronicles 18:16 (id: 113018016)

16Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was the scribe;


## 1 Chronicles 18:17 (id: 113018017)

17Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief officials at the king’s side.


## 1 Chronicles 19:1 (id: 113019001)

1Some time later, Nahash king of the Ammonites died and was succeeded by his son.


## 1 Chronicles 19:2 (id: 113019002)

2And David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to console Hanun concerning his father. But when David’s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him,


## 1 Chronicles 19:3 (id: 113019003)

3the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Just because David has sent you comforters, do you really believe he is showing respect for your father? Have not his servants come to you to explore the land, spy it out, and overthrow it?”


## 1 Chronicles 19:4 (id: 113019004)

4So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved their beards, cut off their garments at the hips, and sent them away.


## 1 Chronicles 19:5 (id: 113019005)

5When someone came and told David about his men, he sent messengers to meet them, since the men had been thoroughly humiliated. The king told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.”


## 1 Chronicles 19:6 (id: 113019006)

6When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Aram\-naharaim, Aram\-maacah, and Zobah.


## 1 Chronicles 19:7 (id: 113019007)

7So they hired for themselves thirty\-two thousand chariots, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba while the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and marched out for battle.


## 1 Chronicles 19:8 (id: 113019008)

8On hearing this, David sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men.


## 1 Chronicles 19:9 (id: 113019009)

9The Ammonites marched out and arrayed themselves for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come stayed by themselves in the open country.


## 1 Chronicles 19:10 (id: 113019010)

10When Joab saw the battle lines before him and behind him, he selected some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans.


## 1 Chronicles 19:11 (id: 113019011)

11And he placed the rest of the troops under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them against the Ammonites.


## 1 Chronicles 19:12 (id: 113019012)

12“If the Arameans are too strong for me,” said Joab, “then you will come to my rescue. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to your rescue.


## 1 Chronicles 19:13 (id: 113019013)

13Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God. May the LORD do what is good in His sight.”


## 1 Chronicles 19:14 (id: 113019014)

14So Joab and his troops advanced to fight the Arameans, who fled before him.


## 1 Chronicles 19:15 (id: 113019015)

15When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they too fled before Joab’s brother Abishai, and they entered the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 19:16 (id: 113019016)

16When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to bring more Arameans from beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.


## 1 Chronicles 19:17 (id: 113019017)

17When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, advanced toward the Arameans, and arrayed for battle against them. When David lined up to engage them in battle, they fought against him.


## 1 Chronicles 19:18 (id: 113019018)

18But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.


## 1 Chronicles 19:19 (id: 113019019)

19When Hadadezer’s subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were unwilling to help the Ammonites anymore.


## 1 Chronicles 20:1 (id: 113020001)

1In the spring, at the time when kings march out to war, Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the Ammonites. He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it.


## 1 Chronicles 20:2 (id: 113020002)

2Then David took the crown from the head of their king. It was found to weigh a talent of gold and was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took a great amount of plunder from the city.


## 1 Chronicles 20:3 (id: 113020003)

3David brought out the people who were there and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. And he did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 20:4 (id: 113020004)

4Some time later, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued.


## 1 Chronicles 20:5 (id: 113020005)

5Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.


## 1 Chronicles 20:6 (id: 113020006)

6And there was also a battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty\-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha,


## 1 Chronicles 20:7 (id: 113020007)

7and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei killed him.


## 1 Chronicles 20:8 (id: 113020008)

8So these descendants of Rapha in Gath fell at the hands of David and his servants.


## 1 Chronicles 21:1 (id: 113021001)

1Then Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 21:2 (id: 113021002)

2So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan and bring me a report, so that I may know their number.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:3 (id: 113021003)

3But Joab replied, “May the LORD multiply His troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all servants of my lord? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”


## 1 Chronicles 21:4 (id: 113021004)

4Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and traveled throughout Israel, and then he returned to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 21:5 (id: 113021005)

5And Joab reported to David the total number of the troops. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, including 470,000 in Judah.


## 1 Chronicles 21:6 (id: 113021006)

6But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count, because the king’s command was detestable to him.


## 1 Chronicles 21:7 (id: 113021007)

7This command was also evil in the sight of God; so He struck Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 21:8 (id: 113021008)

8Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:9 (id: 113021009)

9And the LORD instructed Gad, David’s seer,


## 1 Chronicles 21:10 (id: 113021010)

10“Go and tell David that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it out against you.’”


## 1 Chronicles 21:11 (id: 113021011)

11So Gad went and said to David, “This is what the LORD says: ‘You must choose


## 1 Chronicles 21:12 (id: 113021012)

12between three years of famine, three months of being swept away before your enemies and overtaken by their swords, or three days of the sword of the LORD—days of plague upon the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:13 (id: 113021013)

13David answered Gad, “I am deeply distressed. Please, let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:14 (id: 113021014)

14So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.


## 1 Chronicles 21:15 (id: 113021015)

15Then God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and relented from the calamity, and He said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” At that time the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.


## 1 Chronicles 21:16 (id: 113021016)

16When David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.


## 1 Chronicles 21:17 (id: 113021017)

17And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, please let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house, but do not let this plague remain upon Your people.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:18 (id: 113021018)

18Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.


## 1 Chronicles 21:19 (id: 113021019)

19So David went up at the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.


## 1 Chronicles 21:20 (id: 113021020)

20Now Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.


## 1 Chronicles 21:21 (id: 113021021)

21David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked out and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed facedown before David.


## 1 Chronicles 21:22 (id: 113021022)

22Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the LORD. Sell it to me for the full price, so that the plague upon the people may be halted.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:23 (id: 113021023)

23Ornan said to David, “Take it! May my lord the king do whatever seems good to him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering—I will give it all.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:24 (id: 113021024)

24“No,” replied King David, “I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the LORD what belongs to you, nor will I offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:25 (id: 113021025)

25So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold for the site.


## 1 Chronicles 21:26 (id: 113021026)

26And there he built an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called upon the LORD, who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.


## 1 Chronicles 21:27 (id: 113021027)

27Then the LORD spoke to the angel, who put his sword back into its sheath.


## 1 Chronicles 21:28 (id: 113021028)

28At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.


## 1 Chronicles 21:29 (id: 113021029)

29For the tabernacle of the LORD that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were presently at the high place in Gibeon,


## 1 Chronicles 21:30 (id: 113021030)

30but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.


## 1 Chronicles 22:1 (id: 113022001)

1Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the LORD God, as well as the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:2 (id: 113022002)

2So David gave orders to gather the foreigners in the land of Israel, from whom he appointed stonecutters to prepare finished stones for building the house of God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:3 (id: 113022003)

3David provided a large quantity of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, together with more bronze than could be weighed


## 1 Chronicles 22:4 (id: 113022004)

4and more cedar logs than could be counted; for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David.


## 1 Chronicles 22:5 (id: 113022005)

5And David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent—famous and glorious throughout all lands. Therefore I must make preparations for it.” So David made lavish preparations before his death.


## 1 Chronicles 22:6 (id: 113022006)

6Then David called for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 22:7 (id: 113022007)

7“My son,” said David to Solomon, “it was in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God,


## 1 Chronicles 22:8 (id: 113022008)

8but this word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and waged great wars. You are not to build a house for My Name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me.


## 1 Chronicles 22:9 (id: 113022009)

9But a son will be born to you who will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name will be Solomon, and I will grant to Israel peace and quiet during his reign.


## 1 Chronicles 22:10 (id: 113022010)

10He is the one who will build a house for My Name. He will be My son, and I will be his Father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’


## 1 Chronicles 22:11 (id: 113022011)

11Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as He said you would.


## 1 Chronicles 22:12 (id: 113022012)

12Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding when He puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the Law of the LORD your God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:13 (id: 113022013)

13Then you will succeed, if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.


## 1 Chronicles 22:14 (id: 113022014)

14Now behold, I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD—100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron too great to be weighed. I have also provided timber and stone, and you may add to them.


## 1 Chronicles 22:15 (id: 113022015)

15You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and men skilled in every kind of work—


## 1 Chronicles 22:16 (id: 113022016)

16in gold and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:17 (id: 113022017)

17Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon:


## 1 Chronicles 22:18 (id: 113022018)

18“Is not the LORD your God with you, and has He not granted you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and His people.


## 1 Chronicles 22:19 (id: 113022019)

19Now set your heart and soul to seek the LORD your God. Begin building the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:1 (id: 113023001)

1When David was old and full of years, he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 23:2 (id: 113023002)

2Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites.


## 1 Chronicles 23:3 (id: 113023003)

3The Levites thirty years of age or older were counted, and the total number of men was 38,000\.


## 1 Chronicles 23:4 (id: 113023004)

4“Of these,” said David, “24,000 are to oversee the work of the house of the LORD, 6,000 are to be officers and judges,


## 1 Chronicles 23:5 (id: 113023005)

54,000 are to be gatekeepers, and 4,000 are to praise the LORD with the instruments I have made for giving praise.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:6 (id: 113023006)

6Then David divided the Levites into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.


## 1 Chronicles 23:7 (id: 113023007)

7The Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.


## 1 Chronicles 23:8 (id: 113023008)

8The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first, Zetham, and Joel—three in all.


## 1 Chronicles 23:9 (id: 113023009)

9The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran—three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.


## 1 Chronicles 23:10 (id: 113023010)

10And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei—four in all.


## 1 Chronicles 23:11 (id: 113023011)

11Jahath was the first and Zizah was the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were counted as one family and received a single assignment.


## 1 Chronicles 23:12 (id: 113023012)

12The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four in all.


## 1 Chronicles 23:13 (id: 113023013)

13The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were set apart forever to consecrate the most holy things, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister before Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name forever.


## 1 Chronicles 23:14 (id: 113023014)

14As for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.


## 1 Chronicles 23:15 (id: 113023015)

15The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.


## 1 Chronicles 23:16 (id: 113023016)

16The descendants of Gershom: Shebuel was the first.


## 1 Chronicles 23:17 (id: 113023017)

17The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer did not have any other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.


## 1 Chronicles 23:18 (id: 113023018)

18The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first.


## 1 Chronicles 23:19 (id: 113023019)

19The sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.


## 1 Chronicles 23:20 (id: 113023020)

20The sons of Uzziel: Micah was the first and Isshiah the second.


## 1 Chronicles 23:21 (id: 113023021)

21The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.


## 1 Chronicles 23:22 (id: 113023022)

22Eleazar died without having any sons; he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.


## 1 Chronicles 23:23 (id: 113023023)

23The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth—three in all.


## 1 Chronicles 23:24 (id: 113023024)

24These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families, registered individually by name—those twenty years of age or older who worked in the service of the house of the LORD.


## 1 Chronicles 23:25 (id: 113023025)

25For David had said, “The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to His people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever.


## 1 Chronicles 23:26 (id: 113023026)

26So now the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles for its service.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:27 (id: 113023027)

27For according to the final instructions of David, the Levites twenty years of age or older were counted,


## 1 Chronicles 23:28 (id: 113023028)

28but their duty was to assist the descendants of Aaron with the service of the house of the LORD, being responsible for the courts and chambers, the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God,


## 1 Chronicles 23:29 (id: 113023029)

29as well as for the rows of the showbread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baking, the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.


## 1 Chronicles 23:30 (id: 113023030)

30They were also to stand every morning to give thanks and praise to the LORD, and likewise in the evening.


## 1 Chronicles 23:31 (id: 113023031)

31Whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts, they were to serve regularly before the LORD in the numbers prescribed for them.


## 1 Chronicles 23:32 (id: 113023032)

32So the Levites were to carry out the responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting and the Holy Place, and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, the service of the house of the LORD.


## 1 Chronicles 24:1 (id: 113024001)

1These were the divisions of the descendants of Aaron. The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.


## 1 Chronicles 24:2 (id: 113024002)

2But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.


## 1 Chronicles 24:3 (id: 113024003)

3With the help of Eleazar’s descendant Zadok and Ithamar’s descendant Ahimelech, David divided them according to the offices of their service.


## 1 Chronicles 24:4 (id: 113024004)

4Since more leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than those of Ithamar, they were divided accordingly. There were sixteen heads of families from the descendants of Eleazar and eight from the descendants of Ithamar.


## 1 Chronicles 24:5 (id: 113024005)

5Thus they were divided by lot, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants.


## 1 Chronicles 24:6 (id: 113024006)

6The scribe, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officers: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar, and then one from Ithamar.


## 1 Chronicles 24:7 (id: 113024007)

7The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,


## 1 Chronicles 24:8 (id: 113024008)

17the twenty\-first to Jachin, the twenty\-second to Gamul,


## 1 Chronicles 24:18 (id: 113024018)

18the twenty\-third to Delaiah, and the twenty\-fourth to Maaziah.


## 1 Chronicles 24:19 (id: 113024019)

19This was their appointed order for service when they entered the house of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.


## 1 Chronicles 24:20 (id: 113024020)

20Now these were the rest of the descendants of Levi: From the sons of Amram: Shubael; from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.

29From Kish: Jerahmeel the son of Kish.


## 1 Chronicles 24:30 (id: 113024030)

30And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites, according to their families.


## 1 Chronicles 24:31 (id: 113024031)

31As their brothers the descendants of Aaron did, they also cast lots in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites—the family heads and their younger brothers alike.


## 1 Chronicles 25:1 (id: 113025001)

1Additionally, David and the commanders of the army set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to prophesy with the accompaniment of lyres, harps, and cymbals. The following is the list of the men who performed this service:

## 1 Chronicles 25:5 (id: 113025005)

5All these sons of Heman the king’s seer were given him through the promises of God to exalt him, for God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.


## 1 Chronicles 25:6 (id: 113025006)

6All these were under the direction of their fathers for the music of the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres, for the service of the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the direction of the king.


## 1 Chronicles 25:7 (id: 113025007)

7Together with their relatives, who were all trained and skillful in the songs of the LORD, they numbered 288\.

## 1 Chronicles 29:2 (id: 113029002)

2Now with all my ability I have made provision for the house of my God—gold for the gold articles, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and slabs of marble—all in abundance.


## 1 Chronicles 29:3 (id: 113029003)

3Moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, I now give for it my personal treasures of gold and silver, over and above all that I have provided for this holy temple:

4three thousand talents of gold (the gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings,


## 1 Chronicles 29:5 (id: 113029005)

5for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who is willing to consecrate himself to the LORD today?”


## 1 Chronicles 29:6 (id: 113029006)

6Then the leaders of the families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly.


## 1 Chronicles 29:7 (id: 113029007)

8Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.


## 1 Chronicles 29:9 (id: 113029009)

9And the people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given to the LORD freely and wholeheartedly. And King David also rejoiced greatly.


## 1 Chronicles 29:10 (id: 113029010)

10Then David blessed the LORD in the sight of all the assembly and said: “May You be blessed, O LORD, God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.


## 1 Chronicles 29:11 (id: 113029011)

11Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in heaven and on earth belongs to You. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom, and You are exalted as head over all.

12Both riches and honor come from You, and You are the ruler over all. In Your hands are power and might to exalt and give strength to all.


## 1 Chronicles 29:13 (id: 113029013)

13Now therefore, our God, we give You thanks, and we praise Your glorious name.


## 1 Chronicles 29:14 (id: 113029014)

14But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from You, and from Your own hand we have given to You.


## 1 Chronicles 29:15 (id: 113029015)

15For we are foreigners and strangers in Your presence, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.


## 1 Chronicles 29:16 (id: 113029016)

16O LORD our God, from Your hand comes all this abundance that we have provided to build You a house for Your holy Name, and all of it belongs to You.


## 1 Chronicles 29:17 (id: 113029017)

17I know, my God, that You test the heart and delight in uprightness. All these things I have given willingly and with an upright heart, and now I have seen Your people who are present here giving joyfully and willingly to You.


## 1 Chronicles 29:18 (id: 113029018)

18O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this desire forever in the intentions of the hearts of Your people, and direct their hearts toward You.


## 1 Chronicles 29:19 (id: 113029019)

19And give my son Solomon a whole heart to keep and carry out all Your commandments, decrees, and statutes, and to build Your palace for which I have made provision.”


## 1 Chronicles 29:20 (id: 113029020)

20Then David said to the whole assembly, “Bless the LORD your God.” So the whole assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers. They bowed down and paid homage to the LORD and to the king.


## 1 Chronicles 29:21 (id: 113029021)

24All the officials and mighty men, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.

30together with all the details of his reign, his might, and the circumstances that came upon him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the lands.
