15But when I stumbled, they assembled in glee; they gathered together against me. Assailants I did not know slandered me without ceasing.

15But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.

16Better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of many who are wicked.

17For you hate My instruction and cast My words behind you.

## Psalms 73:4 (id: 119073004)

4They have no struggle in their death; their bodies are well\-fed.


## Psalms 73:5 (id: 119073005)

5They are free of the burdens others carry; they are not afflicted like other men.


## Psalms 73:6 (id: 119073006)

12Behold, these are the wicked—always carefree as they increase their wealth.

## Psalms 73:14 (id: 119073014)

14For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning.


## Psalms 73:15 (id: 119073015)

26My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

27Those far from You will surely perish; You destroy all who are unfaithful to You.

3Turn Your steps to the everlasting ruins, to everything in the sanctuary the enemy has destroyed.

4Your foes have roared within Your meeting place; they have unfurled their banners as signs,


## Psalms 74:5 (id: 119074005)

5like men wielding axes in a thicket of trees


## Psalms 74:6 (id: 119074006)

6and smashing all the carvings with hatchets and picks.


## Psalms 74:7 (id: 119074007)

7They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; they have defiled the dwelling place of Your Name.


## Psalms 74:8 (id: 119074008)

8They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely.” They burned down every place where God met us in the land.

9There are no signs for us to see. There is no longer any prophet. And none of us knows how long this will last.

10How long, O God, will the enemy taunt You? Will the foe revile Your name forever?

3When the earth and all its dwellers quake, it is I who bear up its pillars. Selah


## Psalms 75:4 (id: 119075004)

4I say to the proud, ‘Do not boast,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn.


## Psalms 75:5 (id: 119075005)

5Do not lift up your horn against heaven or speak with an outstretched neck.’”


## Psalms 75:6 (id: 119075006)

6For exaltation comes neither from east nor west, nor out of the desert,


## Psalms 75:7 (id: 119075007)

7but it is God who judges; He brings down one and exalts another.


## Psalms 75:8 (id: 119075008)

4You are resplendent with light, more majestic than mountains filled with game.

5The valiant lie plundered; they sleep their last sleep. No men of might could lift a hand.

6At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and rider lie stunned.


## Psalms 76:7 (id: 119076007)

7You alone are to be feared. When You are angry, who can stand before You?

1I cried out to God; I cried aloud to God to hear me.


## Psalms 77:2 (id: 119077002)

2In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; my soul refused to be comforted.


## Psalms 77:3 (id: 119077003)

3I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; I mused and my spirit grew faint. Selah


## Psalms 77:4 (id: 119077004)

4You have kept my eyes from closing; I am too troubled to speak.


## Psalms 77:5 (id: 119077005)

5I considered the days of old, the years long in the past.


## Psalms 77:6 (id: 119077006)

6At night I remembered my song; in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered:


## Psalms 77:7 (id: 119077007)

7“Will the Lord spurn us forever and never show His favor again?


## Psalms 77:8 (id: 119077008)

8Is His loving devotion gone forever? Has His promise failed for all time?


## Psalms 77:9 (id: 119077009)

9Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has His anger shut off His compassion?” Selah


## Psalms 77:10 (id: 119077010)

10So I said, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”


## Psalms 77:11 (id: 119077011)

11I will remember the works of the LORD; yes, I will remember Your wonders of old.


## Psalms 77:12 (id: 119077012)

12I will reflect on all You have done and ponder Your mighty deeds.


## Psalms 77:13 (id: 119077013)

13Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God?

14You are the God who works wonders; You display Your strength among the peoples.

15With power You redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah


## Psalms 77:16 (id: 119077016)

16The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and swirled; even the depths were shaken.

17The clouds poured down water; the skies resounded with thunder; Your arrows flashed back and forth.

18Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind; the lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.

1Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; listen to the words of my mouth.

2I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the beginning,


## Psalms 78:3 (id: 119078003)

3that we have heard and known and our fathers have relayed to us.


## Psalms 78:4 (id: 119078004)

4We will not hide them from their children but will declare to the next generation the praises of the LORD and His might and the wonders He has performed.


## Psalms 78:5 (id: 119078005)

5For He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers to teach to their children,


## Psalms 78:6 (id: 119078006)

6that the coming generation would know them—even children yet to be born—to arise and tell their own children


## Psalms 78:7 (id: 119078007)

7that they should put their confidence in God, not forgetting His works, but keeping His commandments.


## Psalms 78:8 (id: 119078008)

8Then they will not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose heart was not loyal, whose spirit was not faithful to God.


## Psalms 78:9 (id: 119078009)

9The archers of Ephraim turned back on the day of battle.


## Psalms 78:10 (id: 119078010)

10They failed to keep God’s covenant and refused to live by His law.


## Psalms 78:11 (id: 119078011)

11They forgot what He had done, the wonders He had shown them.


## Psalms 78:12 (id: 119078012)

12He worked wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.


## Psalms 78:13 (id: 119078013)

13He split the sea and brought them through; He set the waters upright like a wall.


## Psalms 78:14 (id: 119078014)

14He led them with a cloud by day and with a light of fire all night.


## Psalms 78:15 (id: 119078015)

15He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as abundant as the seas.


## Psalms 78:16 (id: 119078016)

16He brought streams from the stone and made water flow down like rivers.


## Psalms 78:17 (id: 119078017)

17But they continued to sin against Him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.


## Psalms 78:18 (id: 119078018)

18They willfully tested God by demanding the food they craved.


## Psalms 78:19 (id: 119078019)

19They spoke against God, saying, “Can God really prepare a table in the wilderness?


## Psalms 78:20 (id: 119078020)

20When He struck the rock, water gushed out and torrents raged. But can He also give bread or supply His people with meat?”


## Psalms 78:21 (id: 119078021)

21Therefore the LORD heard and was filled with wrath; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and His anger flared against Israel,


## Psalms 78:22 (id: 119078022)

22because they did not believe God or rely on His salvation.


## Psalms 78:23 (id: 119078023)

23Yet He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of the heavens.


## Psalms 78:24 (id: 119078024)

24He rained down manna for them to eat; He gave them grain from heaven.


## Psalms 78:25 (id: 119078025)

25Man ate the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance.


## Psalms 78:26 (id: 119078026)

26He stirred the east wind from the heavens and drove the south wind by His might.


## Psalms 78:27 (id: 119078027)

27He rained meat on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea.


## Psalms 78:28 (id: 119078028)

28He felled them in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.


## Psalms 78:29 (id: 119078029)

29So they ate and were well filled, for He gave them what they craved.


## Psalms 78:30 (id: 119078030)

30Yet before they had filled their desire, with the food still in their mouths,


## Psalms 78:31 (id: 119078031)

31God’s anger flared against them, and He put to death their strongest and subdued the young men of Israel.


## Psalms 78:32 (id: 119078032)

32In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; despite His wonderful works, they did not believe.


## Psalms 78:33 (id: 119078033)

33So He ended their days in futility, and their years in sudden terror.


## Psalms 78:34 (id: 119078034)

34When He slew them, they would seek Him; they repented and searched for God.


## Psalms 78:35 (id: 119078035)

35And they remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.


## Psalms 78:36 (id: 119078036)

36But they deceived Him with their mouths, and lied to Him with their tongues.


## Psalms 78:37 (id: 119078037)

37Their hearts were disloyal to Him, and they were unfaithful to His covenant.


## Psalms 78:38 (id: 119078038)

38And yet He was compassionate; He forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. He often restrained His anger and did not unleash His full wrath.


## Psalms 78:39 (id: 119078039)

39He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.


## Psalms 78:40 (id: 119078040)

40How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness and grieved Him in the desert!


## Psalms 78:41 (id: 119078041)

41Again and again they tested God and provoked the Holy One of Israel.


## Psalms 78:42 (id: 119078042)

42They did not remember His power—the day He redeemed them from the adversary,


## Psalms 78:43 (id: 119078043)

43when He performed His signs in Egypt and His wonders in the fields of Zoan.


## Psalms 78:44 (id: 119078044)

44He turned their rivers to blood, and from their streams they could not drink.


## Psalms 78:45 (id: 119078045)

45He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.


## Psalms 78:46 (id: 119078046)

46He gave their crops to the grasshopper, the fruit of their labor to the locust.


## Psalms 78:47 (id: 119078047)

47He killed their vines with hailstones and their sycamore\-figs with sleet.


## Psalms 78:48 (id: 119078048)

48He abandoned their cattle to the hail and their livestock to bolts of lightning.


## Psalms 78:49 (id: 119078049)

49He unleashed His fury against them, wrath, indignation, and calamity—a band of destroying angels.


## Psalms 78:50 (id: 119078050)

50He cleared a path for His anger; He did not spare them from death but delivered their lives to the plague.


## Psalms 78:51 (id: 119078051)

51He struck all the firstborn of Egypt, the virility in the tents of Ham.


## Psalms 78:52 (id: 119078052)

52He led out His people like sheep and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.


## Psalms 78:53 (id: 119078053)

53He led them safely, so they did not fear, but the sea engulfed their enemies.


## Psalms 78:54 (id: 119078054)

54He brought them to His holy land, to the mountain His right hand had acquired.


## Psalms 78:55 (id: 119078055)

55He drove out nations before them and apportioned their inheritance; He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.


## Psalms 78:56 (id: 119078056)

56But they tested and disobeyed God Most High, for they did not keep His decrees.


## Psalms 78:57 (id: 119078057)

57They turned back and were faithless like their fathers, twisted like a faulty bow.


## Psalms 78:58 (id: 119078058)

58They enraged Him with their high places and provoked His jealousy with their idols.


## Psalms 78:59 (id: 119078059)

59On hearing it, God was furious and rejected Israel completely.


## Psalms 78:60 (id: 119078060)

60He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent He had pitched among men.


## Psalms 78:61 (id: 119078061)

61He delivered His strength to captivity, and His splendor to the hand of the adversary.


## Psalms 78:62 (id: 119078062)

62He surrendered His people to the sword because He was enraged by His heritage.


## Psalms 78:63 (id: 119078063)

63Fire consumed His young men, and their maidens were left without wedding songs.


## Psalms 78:64 (id: 119078064)

64His priests fell by the sword, but their widows could not lament.


## Psalms 78:65 (id: 119078065)

65Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a mighty warrior overcome by wine.


## Psalms 78:66 (id: 119078066)

66He beat back His foes; He put them to everlasting shame.


## Psalms 78:67 (id: 119078067)

67He rejected the tent of Joseph and refused the tribe of Ephraim.


## Psalms 78:68 (id: 119078068)

68But He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.


## Psalms 78:69 (id: 119078069)

69He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth He has established forever.


## Psalms 78:70 (id: 119078070)

70He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds;


## Psalms 78:71 (id: 119078071)

71from tending the ewes He brought him to be shepherd of His people Jacob, of Israel His inheritance.


## Psalms 78:72 (id: 119078072)

1The nations, O God, have invaded Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy temple and reduced Jerusalem to rubble.


## Psalms 79:2 (id: 119079002)

2They have given the corpses of Your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.


## Psalms 79:3 (id: 119079003)

3They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.


## Psalms 79:4 (id: 119079004)

4We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those around us.


## Psalms 79:5 (id: 119079005)

5How long, O LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?


## Psalms 79:6 (id: 119079006)

6Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that refuse to call on Your name,


## Psalms 79:7 (id: 119079007)

7for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.


## Psalms 79:8 (id: 119079008)

8Do not hold past sins against us; let Your compassion come quickly, for we are brought low.


## Psalms 79:9 (id: 119079009)

9Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; deliver us and atone for our sins, for the sake of Your name.


## Psalms 79:10 (id: 119079010)

10Why should the nations ask, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, make known among the nations Your vengeance for the bloodshed of Your servants.


## Psalms 79:11 (id: 119079011)

11May the groans of the captives reach You; by the strength of Your arm preserve those condemned to death.


## Psalms 79:12 (id: 119079012)

12Pay back into the laps of our neighbors sevenfold the reproach they hurled at You, O Lord.


## Psalms 79:13 (id: 119079013)

8You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and transplanted it.

9You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.


## Psalms 80:10 (id: 119080010)

10The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches.


## Psalms 80:11 (id: 119080011)

11It sent out its branches to the Sea, and its shoots toward the River.


## Psalms 80:12 (id: 119080012)

12Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pick its fruit?


## Psalms 80:13 (id: 119080013)

13The boar from the forest ravages it, and the creatures of the field feed upon it.

11But My people would not listen to Me, and Israel would not obey Me.

17But from everlasting to everlasting the loving devotion of the LORD extends to those who fear Him, and His righteousness to their children’s children—


## Psalms 103:18 (id: 119103018)

18to those who keep His covenant and remember to obey His precepts.


## Psalms 103:19 (id: 119103019)

19The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.


## Psalms 103:20 (id: 119103020)

20Bless the LORD, all His angels mighty in strength who carry out His word, who hearken to the voice of His command.


## Psalms 103:21 (id: 119103021)

21Bless the LORD, all His hosts, you servants who do His will.


## Psalms 103:22 (id: 119103022)

22Bless the LORD, all His works in all places of His dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!


## Psalms 104:1 (id: 119104001)

1Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty.


## Psalms 104:2 (id: 119104002)

2He wraps Himself in light as with a garment; He stretches out the heavens like a tent,


## Psalms 104:3 (id: 119104003)

3laying the beams of His chambers in the waters above, making the clouds His chariot, walking on the wings of the wind.


## Psalms 104:4 (id: 119104004)

4He makes the winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants.


## Psalms 104:5 (id: 119104005)

5He set the earth on its foundations, never to be moved.


## Psalms 104:6 (id: 119104006)

6You covered it with the deep like a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.


## Psalms 104:7 (id: 119104007)

7At Your rebuke the waters fled; at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away—


## Psalms 104:8 (id: 119104008)

8the mountains rose and the valleys sank to the place You assigned for them—


## Psalms 104:9 (id: 119104009)

9You set a boundary they cannot cross, that they may never again cover the earth.


## Psalms 104:10 (id: 119104010)

10He sends forth springs in the valleys; they flow between the mountains.


## Psalms 104:11 (id: 119104011)

11They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.


## Psalms 104:12 (id: 119104012)

12The birds of the air nest beside the springs; they sing among the branches.


## Psalms 104:13 (id: 119104013)

13He waters the mountains from His chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of His works.


## Psalms 104:14 (id: 119104014)

14He makes the grass grow for the livestock and provides crops for man to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth:


## Psalms 104:15 (id: 119104015)

15wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil that makes his face to shine, and bread that sustains his heart.


## Psalms 104:16 (id: 119104016)

16The trees of the LORD have their fill, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted,


## Psalms 104:17 (id: 119104017)

17where the birds build their nests; the stork makes her home in the cypresses.


## Psalms 104:18 (id: 119104018)

18The high mountains are for the wild goats, the cliffs a refuge for the rock badgers.


## Psalms 104:19 (id: 119104019)

19He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.


## Psalms 104:20 (id: 119104020)

20You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the beasts of the forest prowl.


## Psalms 104:21 (id: 119104021)

21The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.


## Psalms 104:22 (id: 119104022)

22The sun rises, and they withdraw; they lie down in their dens.


## Psalms 104:23 (id: 119104023)

23Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until evening.


## Psalms 104:24 (id: 119104024)

24How many are Your works, O LORD! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures.


## Psalms 104:25 (id: 119104025)

25Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number, living things both great and small.


## Psalms 104:26 (id: 119104026)

26There the ships pass, and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there.


## Psalms 104:27 (id: 119104027)

27All creatures look to You to give them their food in due season.


## Psalms 104:28 (id: 119104028)

28When You give it to them, they gather it up; when You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good things.


## Psalms 104:29 (id: 119104029)

29When You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take away their breath, they die and return to dust.


## Psalms 104:30 (id: 119104030)

30When You send Your Spirit, they are created, and You renew the face of the earth.


## Psalms 104:31 (id: 119104031)

31May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in His works.


## Psalms 104:32 (id: 119104032)

32He looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smolder.


## Psalms 104:33 (id: 119104033)

33I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.


## Psalms 104:34 (id: 119104034)

34May my meditation be pleasing to Him, for I rejoice in the LORD.


## Psalms 104:35 (id: 119104035)

35May sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Hallelujah!


## Psalms 105:1 (id: 119105001)

1Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; make known His deeds among the nations.


## Psalms 105:2 (id: 119105002)

2Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.


## Psalms 105:3 (id: 119105003)

3Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.


## Psalms 105:4 (id: 119105004)

4Seek out the LORD and His strength; seek His face always.


## Psalms 105:5 (id: 119105005)

5Remember the wonders He has done, His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,


## Psalms 105:6 (id: 119105006)

6O offspring of His servant Abraham, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.


## Psalms 105:7 (id: 119105007)

7He is the LORD our God; His judgments carry throughout the earth.


## Psalms 105:8 (id: 119105008)

8He remembers His covenant forever, the word He ordained for a thousand generations—


## Psalms 105:9 (id: 119105009)

9the covenant He made with Abraham, and the oath He swore to Isaac.


## Psalms 105:10 (id: 119105010)

10He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:


## Psalms 105:11 (id: 119105011)

11“I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.”


## Psalms 105:12 (id: 119105012)

12When they were few in number, few indeed, and strangers in the land,


## Psalms 105:13 (id: 119105013)

13they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.


## Psalms 105:14 (id: 119105014)

14He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:


## Psalms 105:15 (id: 119105015)

15“Do not touch My anointed ones! Do no harm to My prophets!”


## Psalms 105:16 (id: 119105016)

16He called down famine on the land and cut off all their supplies of food.


## Psalms 105:17 (id: 119105017)

17He sent a man before them—Joseph, sold as a slave.


## Psalms 105:18 (id: 119105018)

18They bruised his feet with shackles and placed his neck in irons,


## Psalms 105:19 (id: 119105019)

19until his prediction came true and the word of the LORD proved him right.


## Psalms 105:20 (id: 119105020)

20The king sent and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free.


## Psalms 105:21 (id: 119105021)

21He made him master of his household, ruler over all his substance,


## Psalms 105:22 (id: 119105022)

22to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.


## Psalms 105:23 (id: 119105023)

23Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.


## Psalms 105:24 (id: 119105024)

24And the LORD made His people very fruitful, more numerous than their foes,


## Psalms 105:25 (id: 119105025)

25whose hearts He turned to hate His people, to conspire against His servants.


## Psalms 105:26 (id: 119105026)

26He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.


## Psalms 105:27 (id: 119105027)

27They performed His miraculous signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.


## Psalms 105:28 (id: 119105028)

28He sent darkness, and it became dark—yet they defied His words.


## Psalms 105:29 (id: 119105029)

29He turned their waters to blood and caused their fish to die.


## Psalms 105:30 (id: 119105030)

30Their land teemed with frogs, even in their royal chambers.


## Psalms 105:31 (id: 119105031)

31He spoke, and insects swarmed—gnats throughout their country.


## Psalms 105:32 (id: 119105032)

32He gave them hail for rain, with lightning throughout their land.


## Psalms 105:33 (id: 119105033)

33He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.


## Psalms 105:34 (id: 119105034)

34He spoke, and the locusts came—young locusts without number.


## Psalms 105:35 (id: 119105035)

35They devoured every plant in their land and consumed the produce of their soil.


## Psalms 105:36 (id: 119105036)

36Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigor.


## Psalms 105:37 (id: 119105037)

37He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and none among His tribes stumbled.


## Psalms 105:38 (id: 119105038)

38Egypt was glad when they departed, for the dread of Israel had fallen on them.


## Psalms 105:39 (id: 119105039)

39He spread a cloud as a covering and a fire to light up the night.


## Psalms 105:40 (id: 119105040)

40They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.


## Psalms 105:41 (id: 119105041)

41He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.


## Psalms 105:42 (id: 119105042)

42For He remembered His holy promise to Abraham His servant.


## Psalms 105:43 (id: 119105043)

43He brought forth His people with rejoicing, His chosen with shouts of joy.


## Psalms 105:44 (id: 119105044)

44He gave them the lands of the nations, that they might inherit the fruit of others’ labor,


## Psalms 105:45 (id: 119105045)

45that they might keep His statutes and obey His laws. Hallelujah!


## Psalms 106:1 (id: 119106001)

1Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.


## Psalms 106:2 (id: 119106002)

2Who can describe the mighty acts of the LORD or fully proclaim His praise?


## Psalms 106:3 (id: 119106003)

3Blessed are those who uphold justice, who practice righteousness at all times.


## Psalms 106:4 (id: 119106004)

4Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation,


## Psalms 106:5 (id: 119106005)

5that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, and give glory with Your inheritance.


## Psalms 106:6 (id: 119106006)

6We have sinned like our fathers; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.


## Psalms 106:7 (id: 119106007)

7Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders or remember Your abundant kindness; but they rebelled by the sea, there at the Red Sea.


## Psalms 106:8 (id: 119106008)

8Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, to make His power known.


## Psalms 106:9 (id: 119106009)

9He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert.


## Psalms 106:10 (id: 119106010)

10He saved them from the hand that hated them; He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.


## Psalms 106:11 (id: 119106011)

11The waters covered their foes; not one of them remained.


## Psalms 106:12 (id: 119106012)

12Then they believed His promises and sang His praise.


## Psalms 106:13 (id: 119106013)

13Yet they soon forgot His works and failed to wait for His counsel.


## Psalms 106:14 (id: 119106014)

14They craved intensely in the wilderness and tested God in the desert.


## Psalms 106:15 (id: 119106015)

15So He granted their request, but sent a wasting disease upon them.


## Psalms 106:16 (id: 119106016)

16In the camp they envied Moses, as well as Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.


## Psalms 106:17 (id: 119106017)

17The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it covered the assembly of Abiram.


## Psalms 106:18 (id: 119106018)

18Then fire blazed through their company; flames consumed the wicked.


## Psalms 106:19 (id: 119106019)

19At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped a molten image.


## Psalms 106:20 (id: 119106020)

20They exchanged their Glory for the image of a grass\-eating ox.


## Psalms 106:21 (id: 119106021)

21They forgot God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt,


## Psalms 106:22 (id: 119106022)

22wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.


## Psalms 106:23 (id: 119106023)

23So He said He would destroy them—had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach to divert His wrath from destroying them.


## Psalms 106:24 (id: 119106024)

24They despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His promise.


## Psalms 106:25 (id: 119106025)

25They grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the voice of the LORD.


## Psalms 106:26 (id: 119106026)

26So He raised His hand and swore to cast them down in the wilderness,


## Psalms 106:27 (id: 119106027)

27to disperse their offspring among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.


## Psalms 106:28 (id: 119106028)

28They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.


## Psalms 106:29 (id: 119106029)

29So they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.


## Psalms 106:30 (id: 119106030)

30But Phinehas stood and intervened, and the plague was restrained.


## Psalms 106:31 (id: 119106031)

31It was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.


## Psalms 106:32 (id: 119106032)

32At the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them.


## Psalms 106:33 (id: 119106033)

33For they rebelled against His Spirit, and Moses spoke rashly with his lips.


## Psalms 106:34 (id: 119106034)

34They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,


## Psalms 106:35 (id: 119106035)

35but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.


## Psalms 106:36 (id: 119106036)

36They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.


## Psalms 106:37 (id: 119106037)

37They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.


## Psalms 106:38 (id: 119106038)

38They shed innocent blood—the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.


## Psalms 106:39 (id: 119106039)

39They defiled themselves by their actions and prostituted themselves by their deeds.


## Psalms 106:40 (id: 119106040)

40So the anger of the LORD burned against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance.


## Psalms 106:41 (id: 119106041)

41He delivered them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.


## Psalms 106:42 (id: 119106042)

42Their enemies oppressed them and subdued them under their hand.


## Psalms 106:43 (id: 119106043)

43Many times He rescued them, but they were bent on rebellion and sank down in their iniquity.


## Psalms 106:44 (id: 119106044)

44Nevertheless He heard their cry; He took note of their distress.


## Psalms 106:45 (id: 119106045)

45And He remembered His covenant with them, and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion.


## Psalms 106:46 (id: 119106046)

46He made them objects of compassion to all who held them captive.


## Psalms 106:47 (id: 119106047)

47Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise.


## Psalms 106:48 (id: 119106048)

48Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah!


## Psalms 107:1 (id: 119107001)

1Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.


## Psalms 107:2 (id: 119107002)

2Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy


## Psalms 107:3 (id: 119107003)

3and gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.


## Psalms 107:4 (id: 119107004)

4Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no path to a city in which to dwell.


## Psalms 107:5 (id: 119107005)

5They were hungry and thirsty; their soul fainted within them.


## Psalms 107:6 (id: 119107006)

6Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them from their distress.


## Psalms 107:7 (id: 119107007)

7He led them on a straight path to reach a city where they could live.


## Psalms 107:8 (id: 119107008)

8Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.


## Psalms 107:9 (id: 119107009)

9For He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.


## Psalms 107:10 (id: 119107010)

10Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and chains,


## Psalms 107:11 (id: 119107011)

11because they rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.


## Psalms 107:12 (id: 119107012)

12He humbled their hearts with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.


## Psalms 107:13 (id: 119107013)

13Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.


## Psalms 107:14 (id: 119107014)

14He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke away their chains.


## Psalms 107:15 (id: 119107015)

15Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.


## Psalms 107:16 (id: 119107016)

16For He has broken down the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.


## Psalms 107:17 (id: 119107017)

17Fools, in their rebellious ways, and through their iniquities, suffered affliction.


## Psalms 107:18 (id: 119107018)

18They loathed all food and drew near to the gates of death.


## Psalms 107:19 (id: 119107019)

19Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.


## Psalms 107:20 (id: 119107020)

20He sent forth His word and healed them; He rescued them from the Pit.


## Psalms 107:21 (id: 119107021)

21Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.


## Psalms 107:22 (id: 119107022)

22Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare His works with rejoicing.


## Psalms 107:23 (id: 119107023)

23Others went out to sea in ships, conducting trade on the mighty waters.


## Psalms 107:24 (id: 119107024)

24They saw the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the deep.


## Psalms 107:25 (id: 119107025)

25For He spoke and raised a tempest that lifted the waves of the sea.


## Psalms 107:26 (id: 119107026)

26They mounted up to the heavens, then sunk to the depths; their courage melted in their anguish.


## Psalms 107:27 (id: 119107027)

27They reeled and staggered like drunkards, and all their skill was useless.


## Psalms 107:28 (id: 119107028)

28Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress.


## Psalms 107:29 (id: 119107029)

29He calmed the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed.


## Psalms 107:30 (id: 119107030)

30They rejoiced in the silence, and He guided them to the harbor they desired.


## Psalms 107:31 (id: 119107031)

31Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.


## Psalms 107:32 (id: 119107032)

32Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the council of the elders.


## Psalms 107:33 (id: 119107033)

33He turns rivers into deserts, springs of water into thirsty ground,


## Psalms 107:34 (id: 119107034)

34and fruitful land into fields of salt, because of the wickedness of its dwellers.


## Psalms 107:35 (id: 119107035)

35He turns a desert into pools of water and a dry land into flowing springs.


## Psalms 107:36 (id: 119107036)

36He causes the hungry to settle there, that they may establish a city in which to dwell.


## Psalms 107:37 (id: 119107037)

37They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest.


## Psalms 107:38 (id: 119107038)

38He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; He does not let their herds diminish.


## Psalms 107:39 (id: 119107039)

39When they are decreased and humbled by oppression, evil, and sorrow,


## Psalms 107:40 (id: 119107040)

40He pours out contempt on the nobles and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
