## John 1:1 (id: 143001001)

1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.


## John 1:2 (id: 143001002)

2He was with God in the beginning.


## John 1:3 (id: 143001003)

3Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made.


## John 1:4 (id: 143001004)

4In Him was life, and that life was the light of men.


## John 1:5 (id: 143001005)

5The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.


## John 1:6 (id: 143001006)

6There came a man who was sent from God. His name was John.


## John 1:7 (id: 143001007)

7He came as a witness to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe.


## John 1:8 (id: 143001008)

8He himself was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.


## John 1:9 (id: 143001009)

9The true Light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.


## John 1:10 (id: 143001010)

10He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him.


## John 1:11 (id: 143001011)

11He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.


## John 1:12 (id: 143001012)

12But to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God—


## John 1:13 (id: 143001013)

13children born not of blood, nor of the desire or will of man, but born of God.


## John 1:14 (id: 143001014)

14The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.


## John 1:15 (id: 143001015)

15John testified concerning Him. He cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’”


## John 1:16 (id: 143001016)

16From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace.


## John 1:17 (id: 143001017)

17For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.


## John 1:18 (id: 143001018)

18No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and is at the Father’s side, has made Him known.


## John 1:19 (id: 143001019)

19And this was John’s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?”


## John 1:20 (id: 143001020)

20He did not refuse to confess, but openly declared, “I am not the Christ.”


## John 1:21 (id: 143001021)

21“Then who are you?” they inquired. “Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.”


## John 1:22 (id: 143001022)

22So they said to him, “Who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”


## John 1:23 (id: 143001023)

23John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet: “I am a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’”


## John 1:24 (id: 143001024)

24Then the Pharisees who had been sent


## John 1:25 (id: 143001025)

25asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”


## John 1:26 (id: 143001026)

26“I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands One you do not know.


## John 1:27 (id: 143001027)

27He is the One who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.”


## John 1:28 (id: 143001028)

28All this happened at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.


## John 1:29 (id: 143001029)

29The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!


## John 1:30 (id: 143001030)

30This is He of whom I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’


## John 1:31 (id: 143001031)

31I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel.”


## John 1:32 (id: 143001032)

32Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and resting on Him.


## John 1:33 (id: 143001033)

33I myself did not know Him, but the One who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is He who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’


## John 1:34 (id: 143001034)

34I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.”


## John 1:35 (id: 143001035)

35The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.


## John 1:36 (id: 143001036)

36When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”


## John 1:37 (id: 143001037)

37And when the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.


## John 1:38 (id: 143001038)

38Jesus turned and saw them following. “What do you want?” He asked. They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are You staying?”


## John 1:39 (id: 143001039)

39“Come and see,” He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and spent that day with Him. It was about the tenth hour.


## John 1:40 (id: 143001040)

40Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John’s testimony and followed Jesus.


## John 1:41 (id: 143001041)

41He first found his brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated as Christ).


## John 1:42 (id: 143001042)

42Andrew brought him to Jesus, who looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated as Peter).


## John 1:43 (id: 143001043)

43The next day Jesus decided to set out for Galilee. Finding Philip, He told him, “Follow Me.”


## John 1:44 (id: 143001044)

44Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.


## John 1:45 (id: 143001045)

45Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, the One the prophets foretold—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”


## John 1:46 (id: 143001046)

46“Can anything good come from Nazareth?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip.


## John 1:47 (id: 143001047)

47When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit.”


## John 1:48 (id: 143001048)

48“How do You know me?” Nathanael asked. Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.”


## John 1:49 (id: 143001049)

49“Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”


## John 1:50 (id: 143001050)

50Jesus said to him, “Do you believe just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.”


## John 1:51 (id: 143001051)

51Then He declared, “Truly, truly, I tell you, you will all see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”


## John 2:1 (id: 143002001)

1On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,


## John 2:2 (id: 143002002)

2and Jesus and His disciples had also been invited to the wedding.


## John 2:3 (id: 143002003)

3When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They have no more wine.”


## John 2:4 (id: 143002004)

4“Woman, what is that to you and to Me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.”


## John 2:5 (id: 143002005)

5His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.”


## John 2:6 (id: 143002006)

6Now six stone water jars had been set there for the Jewish rites of purification. Each could hold from twenty to thirty gallons.


## John 2:7 (id: 143002007)

7Jesus told the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them to the brim.


## John 2:8 (id: 143002008)

8“Now draw some out,” He said, “and take it to the master of the banquet.” They did so,


## John 2:9 (id: 143002009)

9and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not know where it was from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside


## John 2:10 (id: 143002010)

10and said, “Everyone serves the fine wine first, and then the cheap wine after the guests are drunk. But you have saved the fine wine until now!”


## John 2:11 (id: 143002011)

11Jesus performed this, the first of His signs, at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.


## John 2:12 (id: 143002012)

12After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and His disciples, and they stayed there a few days.


## John 2:13 (id: 143002013)

13When the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.


## John 2:14 (id: 143002014)

14In the temple courts He found men selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and money changers seated at their tables.


## John 2:15 (id: 143002015)

15So He made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle. He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.


## John 2:16 (id: 143002016)

16To those selling doves He said, “Get these out of here! How dare you turn My Father’s house into a marketplace!”


## John 2:17 (id: 143002017)

17His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.”


## John 2:18 (id: 143002018)

18On account of this, the Jews demanded, “What sign can You show us to prove Your authority to do these things?”


## John 2:19 (id: 143002019)

19Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.”


## John 2:20 (id: 143002020)

20“This temple took forty\-six years to build,” the Jews replied, “and You are going to raise it up in three days?”


## John 2:21 (id: 143002021)

21But Jesus was speaking about the temple of His body.


## John 2:22 (id: 143002022)

22After He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.


## John 2:23 (id: 143002023)

23While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the signs He was doing and believed in His name.


## John 2:24 (id: 143002024)

24But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew them all.


## John 2:25 (id: 143002025)

25He did not need any testimony about man, for He knew what was in a man.


## John 3:1 (id: 143003001)

1Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews.


## John 3:2 (id: 143003002)

2He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him.”


## John 3:3 (id: 143003003)

3Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.”


## John 3:4 (id: 143003004)

4“How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time to be born?”


## John 3:5 (id: 143003005)

5Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.


## John 3:6 (id: 143003006)

6Flesh is born of flesh, but spirit is born of the Spirit.


## John 3:7 (id: 143003007)

7Do not be amazed that I said, ‘You must be born again.’


## John 3:8 (id: 143003008)

8The wind blows where it wishes. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”


## John 3:9 (id: 143003009)

9“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.


## John 3:10 (id: 143003010)

10“You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and you do not understand these things?


## John 3:11 (id: 143003011)

11Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and yet you people do not accept our testimony.


## John 3:12 (id: 143003012)

12If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?


## John 3:13 (id: 143003013)

13No one has ascended into heaven except the One who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.


## John 3:14 (id: 143003014)

14Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,


## John 3:15 (id: 143003015)

15that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.


## John 3:16 (id: 143003016)

16For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.


## John 3:17 (id: 143003017)

17For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.


## John 3:18 (id: 143003018)

18Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.


## John 3:19 (id: 143003019)

19And this is the verdict: The Light has come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil.


## John 3:20 (id: 143003020)

20Everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come into the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.


## John 3:21 (id: 143003021)

21But whoever practices the truth comes into the Light, so that it may be seen clearly that what he has done has been accomplished in God.”


## John 3:22 (id: 143003022)

22After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent some time with them and baptized.


## John 3:23 (id: 143003023)

23Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because the water was plentiful there, and people kept coming to be baptized.


## John 3:24 (id: 143003024)

24(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)


## John 3:25 (id: 143003025)

25Then a dispute arose between John’s disciples and a certain Jew over the issue of ceremonial washing.


## John 3:26 (id: 143003026)

26So John’s disciples came to him and said, “Look, Rabbi, the One who was with you beyond the Jordan, the One you testified about—He is baptizing, and everyone is going to Him.”


## John 3:27 (id: 143003027)

27John replied, “A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.


## John 3:28 (id: 143003028)

28You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but am sent ahead of Him.’


## John 3:29 (id: 143003029)

29The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens for him, and is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.


## John 3:30 (id: 143003030)

30He must increase; I must decrease.


## John 3:31 (id: 143003031)

31The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The One who comes from heaven is above all.


## John 3:32 (id: 143003032)

32He testifies to what He has seen and heard, yet no one accepts His testimony.


## John 3:33 (id: 143003033)

33Whoever accepts His testimony has certified that God is truthful.


## John 3:34 (id: 143003034)

34For the One whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.


## John 3:35 (id: 143003035)

35The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in His hands.


## John 3:36 (id: 143003036)

36Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. Whoever rejects the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him.”


## John 4:1 (id: 143004001)

1When Jesus realized that the Pharisees were aware He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John


## John 4:2 (id: 143004002)

2(although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples),


## John 4:3 (id: 143004003)

3He left Judea and returned to Galilee.


## John 4:4 (id: 143004004)

4Now He had to pass through Samaria.


## John 4:5 (id: 143004005)

5So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.


## John 4:6 (id: 143004006)

6Since Jacob’s well was there, Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.


## John 4:7 (id: 143004007)

7When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.”


## John 4:8 (id: 143004008)

8(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)


## John 4:9 (id: 143004009)

9“You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)


## John 4:10 (id: 143004010)

10Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”


## John 4:11 (id: 143004011)

11“Sir,” the woman replied, “You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then will You get this living water?


## John 4:12 (id: 143004012)

12Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?”


## John 4:13 (id: 143004013)

13Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.


## John 4:14 (id: 143004014)

14But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.”


## John 4:15 (id: 143004015)

15The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”


## John 4:16 (id: 143004016)

16Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.”


## John 4:17 (id: 143004017)

17“I have no husband,” the woman replied. Jesus said to her, “You are correct to say that you have no husband.


## John 4:18 (id: 143004018)

18In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have spoken truthfully.”


## John 4:19 (id: 143004019)

19“Sir,” the woman said, “I see that You are a prophet.


## John 4:20 (id: 143004020)

20Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.”


## John 4:21 (id: 143004021)

21“Believe Me, woman,” Jesus replied, “a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.


## John 4:22 (id: 143004022)

22You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.


## John 4:23 (id: 143004023)

23But a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father is seeking such as these to worship Him.


## John 4:24 (id: 143004024)

24God is Spirit, and His worshipers must worship Him in spirit and in truth.”


## John 4:25 (id: 143004025)

25The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”


## John 4:26 (id: 143004026)

26Jesus answered, “I who speak to you am He.”


## John 4:27 (id: 143004027)

27Just then His disciples returned and were surprised that He was speaking with a woman. But no one asked Him, “What do You want from her?” or “Why are You talking with her?”


## John 4:28 (id: 143004028)

28Then the woman left her water jar, went back into the town, and said to the people,


## John 4:29 (id: 143004029)

29“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”


## John 4:30 (id: 143004030)

30So they left the town and made their way toward Jesus.


## John 4:31 (id: 143004031)

31Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, eat something.”


## John 4:32 (id: 143004032)

32But He told them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”


## John 4:33 (id: 143004033)

33So the disciples asked one another, “Could someone have brought Him food?”


## John 4:34 (id: 143004034)

34Jesus explained, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.


## John 4:35 (id: 143004035)

35Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe for harvest.


## John 4:36 (id: 143004036)

36Already the reaper draws his wages and gathers a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.


## John 4:37 (id: 143004037)

37For in this case the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.


## John 4:38 (id: 143004038)

38I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the hard work, and now you have taken up their labor.”


## John 4:39 (id: 143004039)

39Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”


## John 4:40 (id: 143004040)

40So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed two days.


## John 4:41 (id: 143004041)

41And many more believed because of His message.


## John 4:42 (id: 143004042)

42They said to the woman, “We now believe not only because of your words; we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the Savior of the world.”


## John 4:43 (id: 143004043)

43After two days, Jesus left for Galilee.


## John 4:44 (id: 143004044)

44Now He Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.


## John 4:45 (id: 143004045)

45Yet when He arrived, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had gone there as well.


## John 4:46 (id: 143004046)

46So once again He came to Cana in Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.


## John 4:47 (id: 143004047)

47When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.


## John 4:48 (id: 143004048)

48Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”


## John 4:49 (id: 143004049)

49“Sir,” the official said, “come down before my child dies.”


## John 4:50 (id: 143004050)

50“Go,” said Jesus. “Your son will live.” The man took Jesus at His word and departed.


## John 4:51 (id: 143004051)

51And while he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive.


## John 4:52 (id: 143004052)

52So he inquired as to the hour when his son had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.”


## John 4:53 (id: 143004053)

53Then the father realized that this was the very hour in which Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” And he and all his household believed.


## John 4:54 (id: 143004054)

54This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judea into Galilee.


## John 5:1 (id: 143005001)

1Some time later there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.


## John 5:2 (id: 143005002)

2Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool with five covered colonnades, which in Hebrew is called Bethesda.


## John 5:3 (id: 143005003)

3On these walkways lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.


## John 5:5 (id: 143005005)

5One man there had been an invalid for thirty\-eight years.


## John 5:6 (id: 143005006)

6When Jesus saw him lying there and realized that he had spent a long time in this condition, He asked him, “Do you want to get well?”


## John 5:7 (id: 143005007)

7“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.”


## John 5:8 (id: 143005008)

8Then Jesus told him, “Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.”


## John 5:9 (id: 143005009)

9Immediately the man was made well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk. Now this happened on the Sabbath day,


## John 5:10 (id: 143005010)

10so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.”


## John 5:11 (id: 143005011)

11But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”


## John 5:12 (id: 143005012)

12“Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?” they asked.


## John 5:13 (id: 143005013)

13But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there.


## John 5:14 (id: 143005014)

14Afterward, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you.”


## John 5:15 (id: 143005015)

15And the man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.


## John 5:16 (id: 143005016)

16Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute Him.


## John 5:17 (id: 143005017)

17But Jesus answered them, “To this very day My Father is at His work, and I too am working.”


## John 5:18 (id: 143005018)

18Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.


## John 5:19 (id: 143005019)

19So Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He sees the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does.


## John 5:20 (id: 143005020)

20The Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does. And to your amazement, He will show Him even greater works than these.


## John 5:21 (id: 143005021)

21For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes.


## John 5:22 (id: 143005022)

22Furthermore, the Father judges no one, but has assigned all judgment to the Son,


## John 5:23 (id: 143005023)

23so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.


## John 5:24 (id: 143005024)

24Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over from death to life.


## John 5:25 (id: 143005025)

25Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.


## John 5:26 (id: 143005026)

26For as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.


## John 5:27 (id: 143005027)

27And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.


## John 5:28 (id: 143005028)

28Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice


## John 5:29 (id: 143005029)

29and come out—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.


## John 5:30 (id: 143005030)

30I can do nothing by Myself; I judge only as I hear. And My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.


## John 5:31 (id: 143005031)

31If I testify about Myself, My testimony is not valid.


## John 5:32 (id: 143005032)

32There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that His testimony about Me is valid.


## John 5:33 (id: 143005033)

33You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.


## John 5:34 (id: 143005034)

34Even though I do not accept human testimony, I say these things so that you may be saved.


## John 5:35 (id: 143005035)

35John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you were willing for a season to bask in his light.


## John 5:36 (id: 143005036)

36But I have testimony more substantial than that of John. For the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works I am doing—testify about Me that the Father has sent Me.


## John 5:37 (id: 143005037)

37And the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form,


## John 5:38 (id: 143005038)

38nor does His word abide in you, because you do not believe the One He sent.


## John 5:39 (id: 143005039)

39You pore over the Scriptures because you presume that by them you possess eternal life. These are the very words that testify about Me,


## John 5:40 (id: 143005040)

40yet you refuse to come to Me to have life.


## John 5:41 (id: 143005041)

41I do not accept glory from men,


## John 5:42 (id: 143005042)

42but I know you, that you do not have the love of God within you.


## John 5:43 (id: 143005043)

43I have come in My Father’s name, and you have not received Me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will receive him.


## John 5:44 (id: 143005044)

44How can you believe if you accept glory from one another, yet do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?


## John 5:45 (id: 143005045)

45Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you have put your hope.


## John 5:46 (id: 143005046)

46If you had believed Moses, you would believe Me, because he wrote about Me.


## John 5:47 (id: 143005047)

47But since you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?”


## John 6:1 (id: 143006001)

1After this, Jesus crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias).


## John 6:2 (id: 143006002)

2A large crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He was performing on the sick.


## John 6:3 (id: 143006003)

3Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples.


## John 6:4 (id: 143006004)

4Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near.


## John 6:5 (id: 143006005)

5When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him, He said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?”


## John 6:6 (id: 143006006)

6But He was asking this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do.


## John 6:7 (id: 143006007)

7Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.”


## John 6:8 (id: 143006008)

8One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,


## John 6:9 (id: 143006009)

9“Here is a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among so many?”


## John 6:10 (id: 143006010)

10“Have the people sit down,” Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them.


## John 6:11 (id: 143006011)

11Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted.


## John 6:12 (id: 143006012)

12And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.”


## John 6:13 (id: 143006013)

13So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.


## John 6:14 (id: 143006014)

14When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they began to say, “Truly this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”


## John 6:15 (id: 143006015)

15Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and make Him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by Himself.


## John 6:16 (id: 143006016)

16When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,


## John 6:17 (id: 143006017)

17got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet gone out to them.


## John 6:18 (id: 143006018)

18A strong wind was blowing, and the sea grew agitated.


## John 6:19 (id: 143006019)

19When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the sea—and they were terrified.


## John 6:20 (id: 143006020)

20But Jesus spoke up: “It is I; do not be afraid.”


## John 6:21 (id: 143006021)

21Then they were willing to take Him into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were heading.


## John 6:22 (id: 143006022)

22The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they had gone away alone.


## John 6:23 (id: 143006023)

23However, some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.


## John 6:24 (id: 143006024)

24So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Him.


## John 6:25 (id: 143006025)

25When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”


## John 6:26 (id: 143006026)

26Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.


## John 6:27 (id: 143006027)

27Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him God the Father has placed His seal of approval.”


## John 6:28 (id: 143006028)

28Then they inquired, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”


## John 6:29 (id: 143006029)

29Jesus replied, “The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent.”


## John 6:30 (id: 143006030)

30So they asked Him, “What sign then will You perform, so that we may see it and believe You? What will You do?


## John 6:31 (id: 143006031)

31Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”


## John 6:32 (id: 143006032)

32Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.


## John 6:33 (id: 143006033)

33For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”


## John 6:34 (id: 143006034)

34“Sir,” they said, “give us this bread at all times.”


## John 6:35 (id: 143006035)

35Jesus answered, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst.


## John 6:36 (id: 143006036)

36But as I stated, you have seen Me and still you do not believe.


## John 6:37 (id: 143006037)

37Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never drive away.


## John 6:38 (id: 143006038)

38For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but to do the will of Him who sent Me.


## John 6:39 (id: 143006039)

39And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that I shall lose none of those He has given Me, but raise them up at the last day.


## John 6:40 (id: 143006040)

40For it is My Father’s will that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”


## John 6:41 (id: 143006041)

41At this, the Jews began to grumble about Jesus because He had said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”


## John 6:42 (id: 143006042)

42They were asking, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then can He say, ‘I have come down from heaven?’”


## John 6:43 (id: 143006043)

43“Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus replied.


## John 6:44 (id: 143006044)

44“No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.


## John 6:45 (id: 143006045)

45It is written in the Prophets: ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to Me—


## John 6:46 (id: 143006046)

46not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only He has seen the Father.


## John 6:47 (id: 143006047)

47Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life.


## John 6:48 (id: 143006048)

48I am the bread of life.


## John 6:49 (id: 143006049)

49Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.


## John 6:50 (id: 143006050)

50This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.


## John 6:51 (id: 143006051)

51I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And this bread, which I will give for the life of the world, is My flesh.”


## John 6:52 (id: 143006052)

52At this, the Jews began to argue among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”


## John 6:53 (id: 143006053)

53So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, you have no life in you.


## John 6:54 (id: 143006054)

54Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.


## John 6:55 (id: 143006055)

55For My flesh is real food, and My blood is real drink.


## John 6:56 (id: 143006056)

56Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.


## John 6:57 (id: 143006057)

57Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.


## John 6:58 (id: 143006058)

58This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your fathers, who ate the manna and died, the one who eats this bread will live forever.”


## John 6:59 (id: 143006059)

59Jesus said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.


## John 6:60 (id: 143006060)

60On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?”


## John 6:61 (id: 143006061)

61Aware that His disciples were grumbling about this teaching, Jesus asked them, “Does this offend you?


## John 6:62 (id: 143006062)

62Then what will happen if you see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before?


## John 6:63 (id: 143006063)

63The Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.


## John 6:64 (id: 143006064)

64However, there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray Him.)


## John 6:65 (id: 143006065)

65Then Jesus said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless the Father has granted it to him.”


## John 6:66 (id: 143006066)

66From that time on many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him.


## John 6:67 (id: 143006067)

67So Jesus asked the Twelve, “Do you want to leave too?”


## John 6:68 (id: 143006068)

68Simon Peter replied, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.


## John 6:69 (id: 143006069)

69We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God.”


## John 6:70 (id: 143006070)

70Jesus answered them, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!”


## John 6:71 (id: 143006071)

71He was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For although Judas was one of the Twelve, he was later to betray Jesus.


## John 7:1 (id: 143007001)

1After this, Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jews there were trying to kill Him.


## John 7:2 (id: 143007002)

2However, the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.


## John 7:3 (id: 143007003)

3So Jesus’ brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to Judea, so that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing.


## John 7:4 (id: 143007004)

4For no one who wants to be known publicly acts in secret. Since You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.”


## John 7:5 (id: 143007005)

5For even His own brothers did not believe in Him.


## John 7:6 (id: 143007006)

6Therefore Jesus told them, “Although your time is always at hand, My time has not yet come.


## John 7:7 (id: 143007007)

7The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify that its works are evil.


## John 7:8 (id: 143007008)

8Go up to the feast on your own. I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet come.”


## John 7:9 (id: 143007009)

9Having said this, Jesus remained in Galilee.


## John 7:10 (id: 143007010)

10But after His brothers had gone up to the feast, He also went—not publicly, but in secret.


## John 7:11 (id: 143007011)

11So the Jews were looking for Him at the feast and asking, “Where is He?”


## John 7:12 (id: 143007012)

12Many in the crowds were whispering about Him. Some said, “He is a good man.” But others replied, “No, He deceives the people.”


## John 7:13 (id: 143007013)

13Yet no one would speak publicly about Him for fear of the Jews.


## John 7:14 (id: 143007014)

14About halfway through the feast, Jesus went up to the temple courts and began to teach.


## John 7:15 (id: 143007015)

15The Jews were amazed and asked, “How did this man attain such learning without having studied?”


## John 7:16 (id: 143007016)

16“My teaching is not My own,” Jesus replied. “It comes from Him who sent Me.


## John 7:17 (id: 143007017)

17If anyone desires to do His will, he will know whether My teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own.


## John 7:18 (id: 143007018)

18He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is a man of truth; in Him there is no falsehood.


## John 7:19 (id: 143007019)

19Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps it. Why are you trying to kill Me?”


## John 7:20 (id: 143007020)

20“You have a demon,” the crowd replied. “Who is trying to kill You?”


## John 7:21 (id: 143007021)

21Jesus answered them, “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed.


## John 7:22 (id: 143007022)

22But because Moses gave you circumcision, you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs.)


## John 7:23 (id: 143007023)

23If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses will not be broken, why are you angry with Me for making the whole man well on the Sabbath?


## John 7:24 (id: 143007024)

24Stop judging by outward appearances, and start judging justly.”


## John 7:25 (id: 143007025)

25Then some of the people of Jerusalem began to say, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?


## John 7:26 (id: 143007026)

26Yet here He is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying anything to Him. Have the rulers truly recognized that this is the Christ?


## John 7:27 (id: 143007027)

27But we know where this man is from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from.”


## John 7:28 (id: 143007028)

28Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “You know Me, and you know where I am from. I have not come of My own accord, but He who sent Me is true. You do not know Him,


## John 7:29 (id: 143007029)

29but I know Him, because I am from Him and He sent Me.”


## John 7:30 (id: 143007030)

30So they tried to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.


## John 7:31 (id: 143007031)

31Many in the crowd, however, believed in Him and said, “When the Christ comes, will He perform more signs than this man?”


## John 7:32 (id: 143007032)

32When the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus, they and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him.


## John 7:33 (id: 143007033)

33So Jesus said, “I am with you only a little while longer, and then I am going to the One who sent Me.


## John 7:34 (id: 143007034)

34You will look for Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.”


## John 7:35 (id: 143007035)

35At this, the Jews said to one another, “Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him? Will He go where the Jews are dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?


## John 7:36 (id: 143007036)

36What does He mean by saying, ‘You will look for Me, but you will not find Me,’ and, ‘Where I am, you cannot come’?”


## John 7:37 (id: 143007037)

37On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and called out in a loud voice, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.


## John 7:38 (id: 143007038)

38Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said: ‘Streams of living water will flow from within him.’”


## John 7:39 (id: 143007039)

39He was speaking about the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were later to receive. For the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.


## John 7:40 (id: 143007040)

40On hearing these words, some of the people said, “This is truly the Prophet.”


## John 7:41 (id: 143007041)

41Others declared, “This is the Christ.” But still others asked, “How can the Christ come from Galilee?


## John 7:42 (id: 143007042)

42Doesn’t the Scripture say that the Christ will come from the line of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?”


## John 7:43 (id: 143007043)

43So there was division in the crowd because of Jesus.


## John 7:44 (id: 143007044)

44Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him.


## John 7:45 (id: 143007045)

45Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring Him in?”


## John 7:46 (id: 143007046)

46“Never has anyone spoken like this man!” the officers answered.


## John 7:47 (id: 143007047)

47“Have you also been deceived?” replied the Pharisees.


## John 7:48 (id: 143007048)

48“Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him?


## John 7:49 (id: 143007049)

49But this crowd that does not know the law—they are under a curse.”


## John 7:50 (id: 143007050)

50Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who himself was one of them, asked,


## John 7:51 (id: 143007051)

51“Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to determine what he has done?”


## John 7:52 (id: 143007052)

52“Aren’t you also from Galilee?” they replied. “Look into it, and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.”


## John 7:53 (id: 143007053)

53Then each went to his own home.


## John 8:1 (id: 143008001)

1But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.


## John 8:2 (id: 143008002)

2Early in the morning He went back into the temple courts. All the people came to Him, and He sat down to teach them.


## John 8:3 (id: 143008003)

3The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before them


## John 8:4 (id: 143008004)

4and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.


## John 8:5 (id: 143008005)

5In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do You say?”


## John 8:6 (id: 143008006)

6They said this to test Him, in order to have a basis for accusing Him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with His finger.


## John 8:7 (id: 143008007)

7When they continued to question Him, He straightened up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.”


## John 8:8 (id: 143008008)

8And again He bent down and wrote on the ground.


## John 8:9 (id: 143008009)

9When they heard this, they began to go away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there.


## John 8:10 (id: 143008010)

10Then Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?”


## John 8:11 (id: 143008011)

11“No one, Lord,” she answered. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Now go and sin no more.”


## John 8:12 (id: 143008012)

12Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”


## John 8:13 (id: 143008013)

13So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.”


## John 8:14 (id: 143008014)

14Jesus replied, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going.


## John 8:15 (id: 143008015)

15You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.


## John 8:16 (id: 143008016)

16But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone; I am with the Father who sent Me.


## John 8:17 (id: 143008017)

17Even in your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.


## John 8:18 (id: 143008018)

18I am One who testifies about Myself, and the Father, who sent Me, also testifies about Me.”


## John 8:19 (id: 143008019)

19“Where is Your Father?” they asked Him. “You do not know Me or My Father,” Jesus answered. “If you knew Me, you would know My Father as well.”


## John 8:20 (id: 143008020)

20He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.


## John 8:21 (id: 143008021)

21Again He said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for Me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”


## John 8:22 (id: 143008022)

22So the Jews began to ask, “Will He kill Himself, since He says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”


## John 8:23 (id: 143008023)

23Then He told them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.


## John 8:24 (id: 143008024)

24That is why I told you that you would die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”


## John 8:25 (id: 143008025)

25“Who are You?” they asked. “Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus replied.


## John 8:26 (id: 143008026)

26“I have much to say about you and much to judge. But the One who sent Me is truthful, and what I have heard from Him, I tell the world.”


## John 8:27 (id: 143008027)

27They did not understand that He was telling them about the Father.


## John 8:28 (id: 143008028)

28So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on My own, but speak exactly what the Father has taught Me.


## John 8:29 (id: 143008029)

29He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.”


## John 8:30 (id: 143008030)

30As Jesus spoke these things, many believed in Him.


## John 8:31 (id: 143008031)

31So He said to the Jews who had believed Him, “If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples.


## John 8:32 (id: 143008032)

32Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”


## John 8:33 (id: 143008033)

33“We are Abraham’s descendants,” they answered. “We have never been slaves to anyone. How can You say we will be set free?”


## John 8:34 (id: 143008034)

34Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.


## John 8:35 (id: 143008035)

35A slave does not remain in the house forever, but a son remains forever.


## John 8:36 (id: 143008036)

36So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.


## John 8:37 (id: 143008037)

37I know you are Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill Me because My word has no place within you.


## John 8:38 (id: 143008038)

38I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”


## John 8:39 (id: 143008039)

39“Abraham is our father,” they replied. “If you were children of Abraham,” said Jesus, “you would do the works of Abraham.


## John 8:40 (id: 143008040)

40But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing.


## John 8:41 (id: 143008041)

41You are doing the works of your father.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they declared. “Our only Father is God Himself.”


## John 8:42 (id: 143008042)

42Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me.


## John 8:43 (id: 143008043)

43Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept My message.


## John 8:44 (id: 143008044)

44You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of lies.


## John 8:45 (id: 143008045)

45But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me!


## John 8:46 (id: 143008046)

46Which of you can prove Me guilty of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me?


## John 8:47 (id: 143008047)

47Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”


## John 8:48 (id: 143008048)

48The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right to say that You are a Samaritan and You have a demon?”


## John 8:49 (id: 143008049)

49“I do not have a demon,” Jesus replied, “but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.


## John 8:50 (id: 143008050)

50I do not seek My own glory. There is One who seeks it, and He is the Judge.


## John 8:51 (id: 143008051)

51Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”


## John 8:52 (id: 143008052)

52“Now we know that You have a demon!” declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet You say that anyone who keeps Your word will never taste death.


## John 8:53 (id: 143008053)

53Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, as did the prophets. Who do You claim to be?”


## John 8:54 (id: 143008054)

54Jesus answered, “If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. The One who glorifies Me is My Father, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’


## John 8:55 (id: 143008055)

55You do not know Him, but I know Him. If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word.


## John 8:56 (id: 143008056)

56Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see My day. He saw it and was glad.”


## John 8:57 (id: 143008057)

57Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?”


## John 8:58 (id: 143008058)

58“Truly, truly, I tell you,” Jesus declared, “before Abraham was born, I am!”


## John 8:59 (id: 143008059)

59At this, they picked up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple area.


## John 9:1 (id: 143009001)

1Now as Jesus was passing by, He saw a man blind from birth,


## John 9:2 (id: 143009002)

2and His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”


## John 9:3 (id: 143009003)

3Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God would be displayed in him.


## John 9:4 (id: 143009004)

4While it is daytime, we must do the works of Him who sent Me. Night is coming, when no one can work.


## John 9:5 (id: 143009005)

5While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”


## John 9:6 (id: 143009006)

6When Jesus had said this, He spit on the ground, made some mud, and applied it to the man’s eyes.


## John 9:7 (id: 143009007)

7Then He told him, “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came back seeing.


## John 9:8 (id: 143009008)

8At this, his neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging began to ask, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”


## John 9:9 (id: 143009009)

9Some claimed that he was, but others said, “No, he just looks like him.” But the man kept saying, “I am the one.”


## John 9:10 (id: 143009010)

10“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked.


## John 9:11 (id: 143009011)

11He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and anointed my eyes, and He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and received my sight.”


## John 9:12 (id: 143009012)

12“Where is He?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered.


## John 9:13 (id: 143009013)

13They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.


## John 9:14 (id: 143009014)

14Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath.


## John 9:15 (id: 143009015)

15So the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. The man answered, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.”


## John 9:16 (id: 143009016)

16Because of this, some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” And there was division among them.


## John 9:17 (id: 143009017)

17So once again they asked the man who had been blind, “What do you say about Him, since it was your eyes He opened?” “He is a prophet,” the man replied.


## John 9:18 (id: 143009018)

18The Jews still did not believe that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned his parents


## John 9:19 (id: 143009019)

19and asked, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? So how is it that he can now see?”


## John 9:20 (id: 143009020)

20His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and we know he was born blind.


## John 9:21 (id: 143009021)

21But how he can now see or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.”


## John 9:22 (id: 143009022)

22His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already determined that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.


## John 9:23 (id: 143009023)

23That was why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”


## John 9:24 (id: 143009024)

24So a second time they called for the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”


## John 9:25 (id: 143009025)

25He answered, “Whether He is a sinner I do not know. There is one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see!”


## John 9:26 (id: 143009026)

26“What did He do to you?” they asked. “How did He open your eyes?”


## John 9:27 (id: 143009027)

27He replied, “I already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?”


## John 9:28 (id: 143009028)

28Then they heaped insults on him and said, “You are His disciple; we are disciples of Moses.


## John 9:29 (id: 143009029)

29We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.”


## John 9:30 (id: 143009030)

30“That is remarkable indeed!” the man said. “You do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes.


## John 9:31 (id: 143009031)

31We know that God does not listen to sinners, but He does listen to the one who worships Him and does His will.


## John 9:32 (id: 143009032)

32Never before has anyone heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.


## John 9:33 (id: 143009033)

33If this man were not from God, He could do no such thing.”


## John 9:34 (id: 143009034)

34They replied, “You were born in utter sin, and you are instructing us?” And they threw him out.


## John 9:35 (id: 143009035)

35When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, He found the man and said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”


## John 9:36 (id: 143009036)

36“Who is He, Sir?” he replied. “Tell me so that I may believe in Him.”


## John 9:37 (id: 143009037)

37“You have already seen Him,” Jesus answered. “He is the One speaking with you.”


## John 9:38 (id: 143009038)

38“Lord, I believe,” he said. And he worshiped Jesus.


## John 9:39 (id: 143009039)

39Then Jesus declared, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind may see and those who see may become blind.”


## John 9:40 (id: 143009040)

40Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard this, and they asked Him, “Are we blind too?”


## John 9:41 (id: 143009041)

41“If you were blind,” Jesus replied, “you would not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see, your guilt remains.”


## John 10:1 (id: 143010001)

1“Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.


## John 10:2 (id: 143010002)

2But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.


## John 10:3 (id: 143010003)

3The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.


## John 10:4 (id: 143010004)

4When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.


## John 10:5 (id: 143010005)

5But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice.”


## John 10:6 (id: 143010006)

6Jesus spoke to them using this illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them.


## John 10:7 (id: 143010007)

7So He said to them again, “Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.


## John 10:8 (id: 143010008)

8All who came before Me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.


## John 10:9 (id: 143010009)

9I am the gate. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.


## John 10:10 (id: 143010010)

10The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness.


## John 10:11 (id: 143010011)

11I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.


## John 10:12 (id: 143010012)

12The hired hand is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. When he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock.


## John 10:13 (id: 143010013)

13The man runs away because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep.


## John 10:14 (id: 143010014)

14I am the good shepherd. I know My sheep and My sheep know Me,


## John 10:15 (id: 143010015)

15just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.


## John 10:16 (id: 143010016)

16I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them in as well, and they will listen to My voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd.


## John 10:17 (id: 143010017)

17The reason the Father loves Me is that I lay down My life in order to take it up again.


## John 10:18 (id: 143010018)

18No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from My Father.”


## John 10:19 (id: 143010019)

19Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus’ message.


## John 10:20 (id: 143010020)

20Many of them said, “He is demon\-possessed and insane. Why would you listen to Him?”


## John 10:21 (id: 143010021)

21But others replied, “These are not the words of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”


## John 10:22 (id: 143010022)

22At that time the Feast of Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,


## John 10:23 (id: 143010023)

23and Jesus was walking in the temple courts in Solomon’s Colonnade.


## John 10:24 (id: 143010024)

24So the Jews gathered around Him and demanded, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”


## John 10:25 (id: 143010025)

25“I already told you,” Jesus replied, “but you did not believe. The works I do in My Father’s name testify on My behalf.


## John 10:26 (id: 143010026)

26But because you are not My sheep, you refuse to believe.


## John 10:27 (id: 143010027)

27My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me.


## John 10:28 (id: 143010028)

28I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them out of My hand.


## John 10:29 (id: 143010029)

29My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand.


## John 10:30 (id: 143010030)

30I and the Father are one.”


## John 10:31 (id: 143010031)

31At this, the Jews again picked up stones to stone Him.


## John 10:32 (id: 143010032)

32But Jesus responded, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone Me?”


## John 10:33 (id: 143010033)

33“We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, make Yourself out to be God.”


## John 10:34 (id: 143010034)

34Jesus replied, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods’?


## John 10:35 (id: 143010035)

35If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken—


## John 10:36 (id: 143010036)

36then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world? How then can you accuse Me of blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God?


## John 10:37 (id: 143010037)

37If I am not doing the works of My Father, then do not believe Me.


## John 10:38 (id: 143010038)

38But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.”


## John 10:39 (id: 143010039)

39At this, they tried again to seize Him, but He escaped their grasp.


## John 10:40 (id: 143010040)

40Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had first been baptizing, and He stayed there.


## John 10:41 (id: 143010041)

41Many came to Him and said, “Although John never performed a sign, everything he said about this man was true.”


## John 10:42 (id: 143010042)

42And many in that place believed in Jesus.


## John 11:1 (id: 143011001)

1At this time a man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.


## John 11:2 (id: 143011002)

2(Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick, was to anoint the Lord with perfume and wipe His feet with her hair.)


## John 11:3 (id: 143011003)

3So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.”


## John 11:4 (id: 143011004)

4When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”


## John 11:5 (id: 143011005)

5Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.


## John 11:6 (id: 143011006)

6So on hearing that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two days,


## John 11:7 (id: 143011007)

7and then He said to the disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.”


## John 11:8 (id: 143011008)

8“Rabbi,” they replied, “the Jews just tried to stone You, and You are going back there?”


## John 11:9 (id: 143011009)

9Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world.


## John 11:10 (id: 143011010)

10But if anyone walks at night, he will stumble, because he has no light.”


## John 11:11 (id: 143011011)

11After He had said this, He told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.”


## John 11:12 (id: 143011012)

12His disciples replied, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better.”


## John 11:13 (id: 143011013)

13They thought that Jesus was talking about actual sleep, but He was speaking about the death of Lazarus.


## John 11:14 (id: 143011014)

14So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead,


## John 11:15 (id: 143011015)

15and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”


## John 11:16 (id: 143011016)

16Then Thomas called Didymus said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.”


## John 11:17 (id: 143011017)

17When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already spent four days in the tomb.


## John 11:18 (id: 143011018)

18Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, a little less than two miles away,


## John 11:19 (id: 143011019)

19and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them in the loss of their brother.


## John 11:20 (id: 143011020)

20So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him, but Mary stayed at home.


## John 11:21 (id: 143011021)

21Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.


## John 11:22 (id: 143011022)

22But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask of Him.”


## John 11:23 (id: 143011023)

23“Your brother will rise again,” Jesus told her.


## John 11:24 (id: 143011024)

24Martha replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”


## John 11:25 (id: 143011025)

25Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies.


## John 11:26 (id: 143011026)

26And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?”


## John 11:27 (id: 143011027)

27“Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”


## John 11:28 (id: 143011028)

28After Martha had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside to tell her, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.”


## John 11:29 (id: 143011029)

29And when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.


## John 11:30 (id: 143011030)

30Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him.


## John 11:31 (id: 143011031)

31When the Jews who were in the house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.


## John 11:32 (id: 143011032)

32When Mary came to Jesus and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”


## John 11:33 (id: 143011033)

33When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.


## John 11:34 (id: 143011034)

34“Where have you put him?” He asked. “Come and see, Lord,” they answered.


## John 11:35 (id: 143011035)

35Jesus wept.


## John 11:36 (id: 143011036)

36Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”


## John 11:37 (id: 143011037)

37But some of them asked, “Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind also have kept Lazarus from dying?”


## John 11:38 (id: 143011038)

38Jesus, once again deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.


## John 11:39 (id: 143011039)

39“Take away the stone,” Jesus said. “Lord, by now he stinks,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man. “It has already been four days.”


## John 11:40 (id: 143011040)

40Jesus replied, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?”


## John 11:41 (id: 143011041)

41So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.


## John 11:42 (id: 143011042)

42I knew that You always hear Me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, so they may believe that You sent Me.”


## John 11:43 (id: 143011043)

43After Jesus had said this, He called out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”


## John 11:44 (id: 143011044)

44The man who had been dead came out with his hands and feet bound in strips of linen, and his face wrapped in a cloth. “Unwrap him and let him go,” Jesus told them.


## John 11:45 (id: 143011045)

45Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in Him.


## John 11:46 (id: 143011046)

46But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.


## John 11:47 (id: 143011047)

47Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs.


## John 11:48 (id: 143011048)

48If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”


## John 11:49 (id: 143011049)

49But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all!


## John 11:50 (id: 143011050)

50You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”


## John 11:51 (id: 143011051)

51Caiaphas did not say this on his own. Instead, as high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation,


## John 11:52 (id: 143011052)

52and not only for the nation, but also for the scattered children of God, to gather them together into one.


## John 11:53 (id: 143011053)

53So from that day on they plotted to kill Him.


## John 11:54 (id: 143011054)

54As a result, Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness. And He stayed there with the disciples.


## John 11:55 (id: 143011055)

55Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover.


## John 11:56 (id: 143011056)

56They kept looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple courts, “What do you think? Will He come to the feast at all?”


## John 11:57 (id: 143011057)

57But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where He was must report it, so that they could arrest Him.


## John 12:1 (id: 143012001)

1Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, the hometown of Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.


## John 12:2 (id: 143012002)

2So they hosted a dinner for Jesus there. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with Him.


## John 12:3 (id: 143012003)

3Then Mary took about a pint of expensive perfume, made of pure nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.


## John 12:4 (id: 143012004)

4But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray Him, asked,


## John 12:5 (id: 143012005)

5“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?”


## John 12:6 (id: 143012006)

6Judas did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was put into it.


## John 12:7 (id: 143012007)

7“Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “She has kept this perfume in preparation for the day of My burial.


## John 12:8 (id: 143012008)

8The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me.”


## John 12:9 (id: 143012009)

9Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews learned that Jesus was there. And they came not only because of Him, but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.


## John 12:10 (id: 143012010)

10So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,


## John 12:11 (id: 143012011)

11for on account of him many of the Jews were deserting them and believing in Jesus.


## John 12:12 (id: 143012012)

12The next day the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.


## John 12:13 (id: 143012013)

13They took palm branches and went out to meet Him, shouting: “Hosanna!” “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Blessed is the King of Israel!”


## John 12:14 (id: 143012014)

14Finding a young donkey, Jesus sat on it, as it is written:


## John 12:15 (id: 143012015)

15“Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion. See, your King is coming, seated on the colt of a donkey.”


## John 12:16 (id: 143012016)

16At first His disciples did not understand these things, but after Jesus was glorified they remembered what had been done to Him, and they realized that these very things had also been written about Him.


## John 12:17 (id: 143012017)

17Meanwhile, many people who had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.


## John 12:18 (id: 143012018)

18That is also why the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.


## John 12:19 (id: 143012019)

19Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You can see that this is doing you no good. Look how the whole world has gone after Him!”


## John 12:20 (id: 143012020)

20Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.


## John 12:21 (id: 143012021)

21They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”


## John 12:22 (id: 143012022)

22Philip relayed this appeal to Andrew, and both of them went and told Jesus.


## John 12:23 (id: 143012023)

23But Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.


## John 12:24 (id: 143012024)

24Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a seed. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.


## John 12:25 (id: 143012025)

25Whoever loves his life will lose it, but whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.


## John 12:26 (id: 143012026)

26If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, My servant will be as well. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.


## John 12:27 (id: 143012027)

27Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? No, it is for this purpose that I have come to this hour.


## John 12:28 (id: 143012028)

28Father, glorify Your name!” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”


## John 12:29 (id: 143012029)

29The crowd standing there heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to Him.


## John 12:30 (id: 143012030)

30In response, Jesus said, “This voice was not for My benefit, but yours.


## John 12:31 (id: 143012031)

31Now judgment is upon this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out.


## John 12:32 (id: 143012032)

32And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to Myself.”


## John 12:33 (id: 143012033)

33He said this to indicate the kind of death He was going to die.


## John 12:34 (id: 143012034)

34The crowd replied, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever. So how can You say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”


## John 12:35 (id: 143012035)

35Then Jesus told them, “For a little while longer, the Light will be among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.


## John 12:36 (id: 143012036)

36While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of light.” After Jesus had spoken these things, He went away and was hidden from them.


## John 12:37 (id: 143012037)

37Although Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in Him.


## John 12:38 (id: 143012038)

38This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: “Lord, who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”


## John 12:39 (id: 143012039)

39For this reason they were unable to believe. For again, Isaiah says:


## John 12:40 (id: 143012040)

40“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they cannot see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.”


## John 12:41 (id: 143012041)

41Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about Him.


## John 12:42 (id: 143012042)

42Nevertheless, many of the leaders believed in Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue.


## John 12:43 (id: 143012043)

43For they loved praise from men more than praise from God.


## John 12:44 (id: 143012044)

44Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in Me does not believe in Me alone, but in the One who sent Me.


## John 12:45 (id: 143012045)

45And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me.


## John 12:46 (id: 143012046)

46I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in Me should remain in darkness.


## John 12:47 (id: 143012047)

47As for anyone who hears My words and does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.


## John 12:48 (id: 143012048)

48There is a judge for the one who rejects Me and does not receive My words: The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.


## John 12:49 (id: 143012049)

49I have not spoken on My own, but the Father who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and how to say it.


## John 12:50 (id: 143012050)

50And I know that His command leads to eternal life. So I speak exactly what the Father has told Me to say.”


## John 13:1 (id: 143013001)

1It was now just before the Passover Feast, and Jesus knew that His hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the very end.


## John 13:2 (id: 143013002)

2The evening meal was underway, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.


## John 13:3 (id: 143013003)

3Jesus knew that the Father had delivered all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God.


## John 13:4 (id: 143013004)

4So He got up from the supper, laid aside His outer garments, and wrapped a towel around His waist.


## John 13:5 (id: 143013005)

5After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and dry them with the towel that was around Him.


## John 13:6 (id: 143013006)

6He came to Simon Peter, who asked Him, “Lord, are You going to wash my feet?”


## John 13:7 (id: 143013007)

7Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”


## John 13:8 (id: 143013008)

8“Never shall You wash my feet!” Peter told Him. Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.”


## John 13:9 (id: 143013009)

9“Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not only my feet, but my hands and my head as well!”


## John 13:10 (id: 143013010)

10Jesus told him, “Whoever has already bathed needs only to wash his feet, and he will be completely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.”


## John 13:11 (id: 143013011)

11For He knew who would betray Him. That is why He said, “Not all of you are clean.”


## John 13:12 (id: 143013012)

12When Jesus had washed their feet and put on His outer garments, He reclined with them again and asked, “Do you know what I have done for you?


## John 13:13 (id: 143013013)

13You call Me Teacher and Lord, and rightly so, because I am.


## John 13:14 (id: 143013014)

14So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet.


## John 13:15 (id: 143013015)

15I have set you an example so that you should do as I have done for you.


## John 13:16 (id: 143013016)

16Truly, truly, I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.


## John 13:17 (id: 143013017)

17If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.


## John 13:18 (id: 143013018)

18I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: ‘The one who shares My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.’


## John 13:19 (id: 143013019)

19I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it comes to pass, you will believe that I am He.


## John 13:20 (id: 143013020)

20Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever receives the one I send receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives the One who sent Me.”


## John 13:21 (id: 143013021)

21After Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit and testified, “Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”


## John 13:22 (id: 143013022)

22The disciples looked at one another, perplexed as to which of them He meant.


## John 13:23 (id: 143013023)

23One of His disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining at His side.


## John 13:24 (id: 143013024)

24So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus which one He was talking about.


## John 13:25 (id: 143013025)

25Leaning back against Jesus, he asked, “Lord, who is it?”


## John 13:26 (id: 143013026)

26Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I give this morsel after I have dipped it.” Then He dipped the morsel and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot.


## John 13:27 (id: 143013027)

27And when Judas had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to Judas, “What you are about to do, do quickly.”


## John 13:28 (id: 143013028)

28But no one at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him.


## John 13:29 (id: 143013029)

29Since Judas kept the money bag, some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor.


## John 13:30 (id: 143013030)

30As soon as he had received the morsel, Judas went out into the night.


## John 13:31 (id: 143013031)

31When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.


## John 13:32 (id: 143013032)

32If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify the Son in Himself—and will glorify Him at once.


## John 13:33 (id: 143013033)

33Little children, I am with you only a little while longer. You will look for Me, and as I said to the Jews, so now I say to you: ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’


## John 13:34 (id: 143013034)

34A new commandment I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you also must love one another.


## John 13:35 (id: 143013035)

35By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another.”


## John 13:36 (id: 143013036)

36“Lord, where are You going?” Simon Peter asked. Jesus answered, “Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now, but you will follow later.”


## John 13:37 (id: 143013037)

37“Lord,” said Peter, “why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.”


## John 13:38 (id: 143013038)

38“Will you lay down your life for Me?” Jesus replied. “Truly, truly, I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.


## John 14:1 (id: 143014001)

1“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe in Me as well.


## John 14:2 (id: 143014002)

2In My Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?


## John 14:3 (id: 143014003)

3And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and welcome you into My presence, so that you also may be where I am.


## John 14:4 (id: 143014004)

4You know the way to the place where I am going.”


## John 14:5 (id: 143014005)

5“Lord,” said Thomas, “we do not know where You are going, so how can we know the way?”


## John 14:6 (id: 143014006)

6Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.


## John 14:7 (id: 143014007)

7If you had known Me, you would know My Father as well. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.”


## John 14:8 (id: 143014008)

8Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”


## John 14:9 (id: 143014009)

9Jesus replied, “Philip, I have been with you all this time, and still you do not know Me? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?


## John 14:10 (id: 143014010)

10Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words I say to you, I do not speak on My own. Instead, it is the Father dwelling in Me, performing His works.


## John 14:11 (id: 143014011)

11Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me—or at least believe on account of the works themselves.


## John 14:12 (id: 143014012)

12Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever believes in Me will also do the works that I am doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.


## John 14:13 (id: 143014013)

13And I will do whatever you ask in My name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.


## John 14:14 (id: 143014014)

14If you ask Me for anything in My name, I will do it.


## John 14:15 (id: 143014015)

15If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.


## John 14:16 (id: 143014016)

16And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate to be with you forever—


## John 14:17 (id: 143014017)

17the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive Him, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you do know Him, for He abides with you and will be in you.


## John 14:18 (id: 143014018)

18I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.


## John 14:19 (id: 143014019)

19In a little while the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you also will live.


## John 14:20 (id: 143014020)

20On that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you are in Me, and I am in you.


## John 14:21 (id: 143014021)

21Whoever has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me. The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and reveal Myself to him.”


## John 14:22 (id: 143014022)

22Judas (not Iscariot) asked Him, “Lord, why are You going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?”


## John 14:23 (id: 143014023)

23Jesus replied, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him.


## John 14:24 (id: 143014024)

24Whoever does not love Me does not keep My words. The word that you hear is not My own, but it is from the Father who sent Me.


## John 14:25 (id: 143014025)

25All this I have spoken to you while I am still with you.


## John 14:26 (id: 143014026)

26But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have told you.


## John 14:27 (id: 143014027)

27Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled; do not be afraid.


## John 14:28 (id: 143014028)

28You heard Me say, ‘I am going away, and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved Me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.


## John 14:29 (id: 143014029)

29And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you will believe.


## John 14:30 (id: 143014030)

30I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming, and he has no claim on Me.


## John 14:31 (id: 143014031)

31But I do exactly what the Father has commanded Me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Get up! Let us go on from here.


## John 15:1 (id: 143015001)

1“I am the true vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard.


## John 15:2 (id: 143015002)

2He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful.


## John 15:3 (id: 143015003)

3You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.


## John 15:4 (id: 143015004)

4Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me.


## John 15:5 (id: 143015005)

5I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing.


## John 15:6 (id: 143015006)

6If anyone does not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned.


## John 15:7 (id: 143015007)

7If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.


## John 15:8 (id: 143015008)

8This is to My Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My disciples.


## John 15:9 (id: 143015009)

9As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love.


## John 15:10 (id: 143015010)

10If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and remain in His love.


## John 15:11 (id: 143015011)

11I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.


## John 15:12 (id: 143015012)

12This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.


## John 15:13 (id: 143015013)

13Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.


## John 15:14 (id: 143015014)

14You are My friends if you do what I command you.


## John 15:15 (id: 143015015)

15No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you.


## John 15:16 (id: 143015016)

16You did not choose Me, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.


## John 15:17 (id: 143015017)

17This is My command to you: Love one another.


## John 15:18 (id: 143015018)

18If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me first.


## John 15:19 (id: 143015019)

19If you were of the world, it would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.


## John 15:20 (id: 143015020)

20Remember the word that I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well; if they kept My word, they will keep yours as well.


## John 15:21 (id: 143015021)

21But they will treat you like this because of My name, since they do not know the One who sent Me.


## John 15:22 (id: 143015022)

22If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin.


## John 15:23 (id: 143015023)

23Whoever hates Me hates My Father as well.


## John 15:24 (id: 143015024)

24If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father.


## John 15:25 (id: 143015025)

25But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without reason.’


## John 15:26 (id: 143015026)

26When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—He will testify about Me.


## John 15:27 (id: 143015027)

27And you also must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.


## John 16:1 (id: 143016001)

1“I have told you these things so that you will not fall away.


## John 16:2 (id: 143016002)

2They will put you out of the synagogues. In fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God.


## John 16:3 (id: 143016003)

3They will do these things because they have not known the Father or Me.


## John 16:4 (id: 143016004)

4But I have told you these things so that when their hour comes, you will remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.


## John 16:5 (id: 143016005)

5Now, however, I am going to Him who sent Me; yet none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’


## John 16:6 (id: 143016006)

6Instead, your hearts are filled with sorrow because I have told you these things.


## John 16:7 (id: 143016007)

7But I tell you the truth, it is for your benefit that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.


## John 16:8 (id: 143016008)

8And when He comes, He will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment:


## John 16:9 (id: 143016009)

9in regard to sin, because they do not believe in Me;


## John 16:10 (id: 143016010)

10in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see Me;


## John 16:11 (id: 143016011)

11and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world has been condemned.


## John 16:12 (id: 143016012)

12I still have much to tell you, but you cannot yet bear to hear it.


## John 16:13 (id: 143016013)

13However, when the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all truth. For He will not speak on His own, but He will speak what He hears, and He will declare to you what is to come.


## John 16:14 (id: 143016014)

14He will glorify Me by taking from what is Mine and disclosing it to you.


## John 16:15 (id: 143016015)

15Everything that belongs to the Father is Mine. That is why I said that the Spirit will take from what is Mine and disclose it to you.


## John 16:16 (id: 143016016)

16In a little while you will see Me no more, and then after a little while you will see Me.”


## John 16:17 (id: 143016017)

17Then some of His disciples asked one another, “Why is He telling us, ‘In a little while you will not see Me, and then after a little while you will see Me’ and ‘Because I am going to the Father’?”


## John 16:18 (id: 143016018)

18They kept asking, “Why is He saying, ‘a little while’? We do not understand what He is saying.”


## John 16:19 (id: 143016019)

19Aware that they wanted to question Him, Jesus said to them, “Are you asking one another why I said, ‘In a little while you will not see Me, and then after a little while you will see Me’?


## John 16:20 (id: 143016020)

20Truly, truly, I tell you, you will weep and wail while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.


## John 16:21 (id: 143016021)

21A woman has pain in childbirth because her time has come; but when she brings forth her child, she forgets her anguish because of her joy that a child has been born into the world.


## John 16:22 (id: 143016022)

22So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.


## John 16:23 (id: 143016023)

23In that day you will no longer ask Me anything. Truly, truly, I tell you, whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.


## John 16:24 (id: 143016024)

24Until now you have not asked for anything in My name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.


## John 16:25 (id: 143016025)

25I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. An hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you this way, but will tell you plainly about the Father.


## John 16:26 (id: 143016026)

26In that day you will ask in My name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.


## John 16:27 (id: 143016027)

27For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came from God.


## John 16:28 (id: 143016028)

28I came from the Father and entered the world. In turn, I will leave the world and go to the Father.”


## John 16:29 (id: 143016029)

29His disciples said, “See, now You are speaking plainly and without figures of speech.


## John 16:30 (id: 143016030)

30Now we understand that You know all things and that You have no need for anyone to question You. Because of this, we believe that You came from God.”


## John 16:31 (id: 143016031)

31“Do you finally believe?” Jesus replied.


## John 16:32 (id: 143016032)

32“Look, an hour is coming and has already come when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and you will leave Me all alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.


## John 16:33 (id: 143016033)

33I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage; I have overcome the world!”


## John 17:1 (id: 143017001)

1When Jesus had spoken these things, He lifted up His eyes to heaven and said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son may glorify You.


## John 17:2 (id: 143017002)

2For You granted Him authority over all people, so that He may give eternal life to all those You have given Him.


## John 17:3 (id: 143017003)

3Now this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.


## John 17:4 (id: 143017004)

4I have glorified You on earth by accomplishing the work You gave Me to do.


## John 17:5 (id: 143017005)

5And now, Father, glorify Me in Your presence with the glory I had with You before the world existed.


## John 17:6 (id: 143017006)

6I have revealed Your name to those You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours; You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.


## John 17:7 (id: 143017007)

7Now they know that everything You have given Me comes from You.


## John 17:8 (id: 143017008)

8For I have given them the words You gave Me, and they have received them. They knew with certainty that I came from You, and they believed that You sent Me.


## John 17:9 (id: 143017009)

9I ask on their behalf. I do not ask on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those You have given Me; for they are Yours.


## John 17:10 (id: 143017010)

10All I have is Yours, and all You have is Mine; and in them I have been glorified.


## John 17:11 (id: 143017011)

11I will no longer be in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, protect them by Your name, the name You gave Me, so that they may be one as We are one.


## John 17:12 (id: 143017012)

12While I was with them, I protected and preserved them by Your name, the name You gave Me. Not one of them has been lost, except the son of destruction, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled.


## John 17:13 (id: 143017013)

13But now I am coming to You; and I am saying these things while I am in the world, so that they may have My joy fulfilled within them.


## John 17:14 (id: 143017014)

14I have given them Your word and the world has hated them. For they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.


## John 17:15 (id: 143017015)

15I am not asking that You take them out of the world, but that You keep them from the evil one.


## John 17:16 (id: 143017016)

16They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.


## John 17:17 (id: 143017017)

17Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth.


## John 17:18 (id: 143017018)

18As You sent Me into the world, I have also sent them into the world.


## John 17:19 (id: 143017019)

19For them I sanctify Myself, so that they too may be sanctified by the truth.


## John 17:20 (id: 143017020)

20I am not asking on behalf of them alone, but also on behalf of those who will believe in Me through their message,


## John 17:21 (id: 143017021)

21that all of them may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I am in You. May they also be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.


## John 17:22 (id: 143017022)

22I have given them the glory You gave Me, so that they may be one as We are one—


## John 17:23 (id: 143017023)

23I in them and You in Me—that they may be perfectly united, so that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them just as You have loved Me.


## John 17:24 (id: 143017024)

24Father, I want those You have given Me to be with Me where I am, that they may see the glory You gave Me because You loved Me before the foundation of the world.


## John 17:25 (id: 143017025)

25Righteous Father, although the world has not known You, I know You, and they know that You sent Me.


## John 17:26 (id: 143017026)

26And I have made Your name known to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love You have for Me may be in them, and I in them.”


## John 18:1 (id: 143018001)

1After Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where they entered a garden.


## John 18:2 (id: 143018002)

2Now Judas His betrayer also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples.


## John 18:3 (id: 143018003)

3So Judas brought a band of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees. They arrived at the garden carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons.


## John 18:4 (id: 143018004)

4Jesus, knowing all that was coming upon Him, stepped forward and asked them, “Whom are you seeking?”


## John 18:5 (id: 143018005)

5“Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. Jesus said, “I am He.” And Judas His betrayer was standing there with them.


## John 18:6 (id: 143018006)

6When Jesus said, “I am He,” they drew back and fell to the ground.


## John 18:7 (id: 143018007)

7So He asked them again, “Whom are you seeking?” “Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered.


## John 18:8 (id: 143018008)

8“I told you that I am He,” Jesus replied. “So if you are looking for Me, let these men go.”


## John 18:9 (id: 143018009)

9This was to fulfill the word He had spoken: “I have not lost one of those You have given Me.”


## John 18:10 (id: 143018010)

10Then Simon Peter drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.


## John 18:11 (id: 143018011)

11“Put your sword back in its sheath!” Jesus said to Peter. “Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given Me?”


## John 18:12 (id: 143018012)

12Then the band of soldiers, with its commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him.


## John 18:13 (id: 143018013)

13They brought Him first to Annas, who was the father\-in\-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.


## John 18:14 (id: 143018014)

14Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be better if one man died for the people.


## John 18:15 (id: 143018015)

15Now Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he also went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.


## John 18:16 (id: 143018016)

16But Peter stood outside at the door. Then the disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in.


## John 18:17 (id: 143018017)

17At this, the servant girl watching the door said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?” “I am not,” he answered.


## John 18:18 (id: 143018018)

18Because it was cold, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made to keep warm. And Peter was also standing with them, warming himself.


## John 18:19 (id: 143018019)

19Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching.


## John 18:20 (id: 143018020)

20“I have spoken openly to the world,” Jesus answered. “I always taught in the synagogues and at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.


## John 18:21 (id: 143018021)

21Why are you asking Me? Ask those who heard My message. Surely they know what I said.”


## John 18:22 (id: 143018022)

22When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Him in the face and said, “Is this how You answer the high priest?”


## John 18:23 (id: 143018023)

23Jesus replied, “If I said something wrong, testify as to what was wrong. But if I spoke correctly, why did you strike Me?”


## John 18:24 (id: 143018024)

24Then Annas sent Him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.


## John 18:25 (id: 143018025)

25Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself. So they asked him, “Aren’t you also one of His disciples?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”


## John 18:26 (id: 143018026)

26One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Didn’t I see you with Him in the garden?”


## John 18:27 (id: 143018027)

27Peter denied it once more, and immediately a rooster crowed.


## John 18:28 (id: 143018028)

28Then they led Jesus away from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. By now it was early morning, and the Jews did not enter the Praetorium, to avoid being defiled and unable to eat the Passover.


## John 18:29 (id: 143018029)

29So Pilate went out to them and asked, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?”


## John 18:30 (id: 143018030)

30“If He were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed Him over to you.”


## John 18:31 (id: 143018031)

31“You take Him and judge Him by your own law,” Pilate told them. “We are not permitted to execute anyone,” the Jews replied.


## John 18:32 (id: 143018032)

32This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to indicate the kind of death He was going to die.


## John 18:33 (id: 143018033)

33Pilate went back into the Praetorium, summoned Jesus, and asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”


## John 18:34 (id: 143018034)

34“Are you saying this on your own,” Jesus asked, “or did others tell you about Me?”


## John 18:35 (id: 143018035)

35“Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “Your own people and chief priests handed You over to me. What have You done?”


## John 18:36 (id: 143018036)

36Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world; if it were, My servants would fight to prevent My arrest by the Jews. But now My kingdom is not of this realm.”


## John 18:37 (id: 143018037)

37“Then You are a king!” Pilate said. “You say that I am a king,” Jesus answered. “For this reason I was born and have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to My voice.”


## John 18:38 (id: 143018038)

38“What is truth?” Pilate asked. And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against Him.


## John 18:39 (id: 143018039)

39But it is your custom that I release to you one prisoner at the Passover. So then, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”


## John 18:40 (id: 143018040)

40“Not this man,” they shouted, “but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was an insurrectionist.)


## John 19:1 (id: 143019001)

1Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him flogged.


## John 19:2 (id: 143019002)

2The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns, set it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe.


## John 19:3 (id: 143019003)

3And they went up to Him again and again, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him in the face.


## John 19:4 (id: 143019004)

4Once again Pilate came out and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing Him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against Him.”


## John 19:5 (id: 143019005)

5When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”


## John 19:6 (id: 143019006)

6As soon as the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” “You take Him and crucify Him,” Pilate replied, “for I find no basis for a charge against Him.”


## John 19:7 (id: 143019007)

7“We have a law,” answered the Jews, “and according to that law He must die, because He declared Himself to be the Son of God.”


## John 19:8 (id: 143019008)

8When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid,


## John 19:9 (id: 143019009)

9and he went back into the Praetorium. “Where are You from?” he asked. But Jesus gave no answer.


## John 19:10 (id: 143019010)

10So Pilate said to Him, “Do You refuse to speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and authority to crucify You?”


## John 19:11 (id: 143019011)

11Jesus answered, “You would have no authority over Me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed Me over to you is guilty of greater sin.”


## John 19:12 (id: 143019012)

12From then on, Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is defying Caesar.”


## John 19:13 (id: 143019013)

13When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Stone Pavement, which in Hebrew is Gabbatha.


## John 19:14 (id: 143019014)

14It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. And Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is your King!”


## John 19:15 (id: 143019015)

15At this, they shouted, “Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!” “Shall I crucify your King?” Pilate asked. “We have no king but Caesar,” replied the chief priests.


## John 19:16 (id: 143019016)

16Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified, and the soldiers took Him away.


## John 19:17 (id: 143019017)

17Carrying His own cross, He went out to The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.


## John 19:18 (id: 143019018)

18There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.


## John 19:19 (id: 143019019)

19Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.


## John 19:20 (id: 143019020)

20Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.


## John 19:21 (id: 143019021)

21So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’”


## John 19:22 (id: 143019022)

22Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”


## John 19:23 (id: 143019023)

23When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided His garments into four parts, one for each soldier, with the tunic remaining. It was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.


## John 19:24 (id: 143019024)

24So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it. Instead, let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture: “They divided My garments among them, and cast lots for My clothing.” So that is what the soldiers did.


## John 19:25 (id: 143019025)

25Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother and her sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene.


## John 19:26 (id: 143019026)

26When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Woman, here is your son.”


## John 19:27 (id: 143019027)

27Then He said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” So from that hour, this disciple took her into his home.


## John 19:28 (id: 143019028)

28After this, knowing that everything had now been accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.”


## John 19:29 (id: 143019029)

29A jar of sour wine was sitting there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth.


## John 19:30 (id: 143019030)

30When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished.” And bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit.


## John 19:31 (id: 143019031)

31It was the day of Preparation, and the next day was a High Sabbath. In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.


## John 19:32 (id: 143019032)

32So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and those of the other.


## John 19:33 (id: 143019033)

33But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.


## John 19:34 (id: 143019034)

34Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.


## John 19:35 (id: 143019035)

35The one who saw it has testified to this, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.


## John 19:36 (id: 143019036)

36Now these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of His bones will be broken.”


## John 19:37 (id: 143019037)

37And, as another Scripture says: “They will look on the One they have pierced.”


## John 19:38 (id: 143019038)

38Afterward, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he came and removed His body.


## John 19:39 (id: 143019039)

39Nicodemus, who had previously come to Jesus at night, also brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy\-five pounds.


## John 19:40 (id: 143019040)

40So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom.


## John 19:41 (id: 143019041)

41Now there was a garden in the place where Jesus was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.


## John 19:42 (id: 143019042)

42And because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus there.


## John 20:1 (id: 143020001)

1Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.


## John 20:2 (id: 143020002)

2So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,” she said, “and we do not know where they have put Him!”


## John 20:3 (id: 143020003)

3Then Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb.


## John 20:4 (id: 143020004)

4The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.


## John 20:5 (id: 143020005)

5He bent down and looked in at the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.


## John 20:6 (id: 143020006)

6Simon Peter arrived just after him. He entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there.


## John 20:7 (id: 143020007)

7The cloth that had been around Jesus’ head was rolled up, lying separate from the linen cloths.


## John 20:8 (id: 143020008)

8Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in. And he saw and believed.


## John 20:9 (id: 143020009)

9For they still did not understand from the Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.


## John 20:10 (id: 143020010)

10Then the disciples returned to their homes.


## John 20:11 (id: 143020011)

11But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent down to look into the tomb,


## John 20:12 (id: 143020012)

12and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet.


## John 20:13 (id: 143020013)

13“Woman, why are you weeping?” they asked. “Because they have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I do not know where they have put Him.”


## John 20:14 (id: 143020014)

14When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there. But she did not recognize that it was Jesus.


## John 20:15 (id: 143020015)

15“Woman, why are you weeping?” Jesus asked. “Whom are you seeking?” Thinking He was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried Him off, tell me where you have put Him, and I will get Him.”


## John 20:16 (id: 143020016)

16Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”).


## John 20:17 (id: 143020017)

17“Do not cling to Me,” Jesus said, “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go and tell My brothers, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.’”


## John 20:18 (id: 143020018)

18Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what He had said to her.


## John 20:19 (id: 143020019)

19It was the first day of the week, and that very evening, while the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them. “Peace be with you!” He said to them.


## John 20:20 (id: 143020020)

20After He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.


## John 20:21 (id: 143020021)

21Again Jesus said to them, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me, so also I am sending you.”


## John 20:22 (id: 143020022)

22When He had said this, He breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.


## John 20:23 (id: 143020023)

23If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.”


## John 20:24 (id: 143020024)

24Now Thomas called Didymus, one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.


## John 20:25 (id: 143020025)

25So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he replied, “Unless I see the nail marks in His hands, and put my finger where the nails have been, and put my hand into His side, I will never believe.”


## John 20:26 (id: 143020026)

26Eight days later, His disciples were once again inside with the doors locked, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”


## John 20:27 (id: 143020027)

27Then Jesus said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and look at My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe.”


## John 20:28 (id: 143020028)

28Thomas replied, “My Lord and my God!”


## John 20:29 (id: 143020029)

29Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”


## John 20:30 (id: 143020030)

30Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.


## John 20:31 (id: 143020031)

31But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name.


## John 21:1 (id: 143021001)

1Later, by the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus again revealed Himself to the disciples. He made Himself known in this way:


## John 21:2 (id: 143021002)

2Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.


## John 21:3 (id: 143021003)

3Simon Peter told them, “I am going fishing.” “We will go with you,” they said. So they went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.


## John 21:4 (id: 143021004)

4Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not recognize that it was Jesus.


## John 21:5 (id: 143021005)

5So He called out to them, “Children, do you have any fish?” “No,” they answered.


## John 21:6 (id: 143021006)

6He told them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it there, and they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish.


## John 21:7 (id: 143021007)

7Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it) and jumped into the sea.


## John 21:8 (id: 143021008)

8The other disciples came ashore in the boat. They dragged in the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards.


## John 21:9 (id: 143021009)

9When they landed, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it, and some bread.


## John 21:10 (id: 143021010)

10Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”


## John 21:11 (id: 143021011)

11So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many, the net was not torn.


## John 21:12 (id: 143021012)

12“Come, have breakfast,” Jesus said to them. None of the disciples dared to ask Him, “Who are You?” They knew it was the Lord.


## John 21:13 (id: 143021013)

13Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and He did the same with the fish.


## John 21:14 (id: 143021014)

14This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after He was raised from the dead.


## John 21:15 (id: 143021015)

15When they had finished eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love Me more than these?” “Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.” Jesus replied, “Feed My lambs.”


## John 21:16 (id: 143021016)

16Jesus asked a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” “Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.” Jesus told him, “Shepherd My sheep.”


## John 21:17 (id: 143021017)

17Jesus asked a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” Peter was deeply hurt that Jesus had asked him a third time, “Do you love Me?” “Lord, You know all things,” he replied. “You know I love You.” Jesus said to him, “Feed My sheep.


## John 21:18 (id: 143021018)

18Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.”


## John 21:19 (id: 143021019)

19Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. And after He had said this, He told him, “Follow Me.”


## John 21:20 (id: 143021020)

20Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. He was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper to ask, “Lord, who is going to betray You?”


## John 21:21 (id: 143021021)

21When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”


## John 21:22 (id: 143021022)

22Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You follow Me!”


## John 21:23 (id: 143021023)

23Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say that he would not die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?”


## John 21:24 (id: 143021024)

24This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who has written them down. And we know that his testimony is true.


## John 21:25 (id: 143021025)

25There are many more things that Jesus did. If all of them were written down, I suppose that not even the world itself would have space for the books that would be written.
