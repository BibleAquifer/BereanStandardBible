## Matthew 1:1 (id: 140001001)

1This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:


## Matthew 1:2 (id: 140001002)

2Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.


## Matthew 1:3 (id: 140001003)

3Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram.


## Matthew 1:4 (id: 140001004)

4Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.


## Matthew 1:5 (id: 140001005)

5Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,


## Matthew 1:6 (id: 140001006)

6and Jesse the father of David the king. Next: David was the father of Solomon by Uriah’s wife,


## Matthew 1:7 (id: 140001007)

7Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa.


## Matthew 1:8 (id: 140001008)

8Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah.


## Matthew 1:9 (id: 140001009)

9Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.


## Matthew 1:10 (id: 140001010)

10Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,


## Matthew 1:11 (id: 140001011)

11and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.


## Matthew 1:12 (id: 140001012)

12After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,


## Matthew 1:13 (id: 140001013)

13Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor.


## Matthew 1:14 (id: 140001014)

14Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud.


## Matthew 1:15 (id: 140001015)

15Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,


## Matthew 1:16 (id: 140001016)

16and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.


## Matthew 1:17 (id: 140001017)

17In all, then, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.


## Matthew 1:18 (id: 140001018)

18This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.


## Matthew 1:19 (id: 140001019)

19Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly.


## Matthew 1:20 (id: 140001020)

20But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.


## Matthew 1:21 (id: 140001021)

21She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.”


## Matthew 1:22 (id: 140001022)

22All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:


## Matthew 1:23 (id: 140001023)

23“Behold, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call Him Immanuel” (which means, “God with us”).


## Matthew 1:24 (id: 140001024)

24When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and embraced Mary as his wife.


## Matthew 1:25 (id: 140001025)

25But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a Son. And he gave Him the name Jesus.


## Matthew 2:1 (id: 140002001)

1After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,


## Matthew 2:2 (id: 140002002)

2asking, “Where is the One who has been born King of the Jews? We saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.”


## Matthew 2:3 (id: 140002003)

3When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.


## Matthew 2:4 (id: 140002004)

4And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.


## Matthew 2:5 (id: 140002005)

5“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:


## Matthew 2:6 (id: 140002006)

6‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of My people Israel.’”


## Matthew 2:7 (id: 140002007)

7Then Herod called the Magi secretly and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.


## Matthew 2:8 (id: 140002008)

8And sending them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go and search carefully for the Child, and when you find Him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship Him.”


## Matthew 2:9 (id: 140002009)

9After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stood over the place where the Child was.


## Matthew 2:10 (id: 140002010)

10When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great delight.


## Matthew 2:11 (id: 140002011)

11On coming to the house, they saw the Child with His mother Mary, and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.


## Matthew 2:12 (id: 140002012)

12And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another route.


## Matthew 2:13 (id: 140002013)

13When the Magi had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill Him.”


## Matthew 2:14 (id: 140002014)

14So he got up, took the Child and His mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt,


## Matthew 2:15 (id: 140002015)

15where he stayed until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called My Son.”


## Matthew 2:16 (id: 140002016)

16When Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was filled with rage. Sending orders, he put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the Magi.


## Matthew 2:17 (id: 140002017)

17Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:


## Matthew 2:18 (id: 140002018)

18“A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”


## Matthew 2:19 (id: 140002019)

19After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.


## Matthew 2:20 (id: 140002020)

20“Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel, for those seeking the Child’s life are now dead.”


## Matthew 2:21 (id: 140002021)

21So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and went to the land of Israel.


## Matthew 2:22 (id: 140002022)

22But when he learned that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,


## Matthew 2:23 (id: 140002023)

23and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”


## Matthew 3:1 (id: 140003001)

1In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea


## Matthew 3:2 (id: 140003002)

2and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”


## Matthew 3:3 (id: 140003003)

3This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for Him.’”


## Matthew 3:4 (id: 140003004)

4John wore a garment of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.


## Matthew 3:5 (id: 140003005)

5People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region around the Jordan.


## Matthew 3:6 (id: 140003006)

6Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.


## Matthew 3:7 (id: 140003007)

7But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his place of baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?


## Matthew 3:8 (id: 140003008)

8Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance.


## Matthew 3:9 (id: 140003009)

9And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.


## Matthew 3:10 (id: 140003010)

10The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.


## Matthew 3:11 (id: 140003011)

11I baptize you with water for repentance, but after me will come One more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.


## Matthew 3:12 (id: 140003012)

12His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and to gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”


## Matthew 3:13 (id: 140003013)

13At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.


## Matthew 3:14 (id: 140003014)

14But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?”


## Matthew 3:15 (id: 140003015)

15“Let it be so now,” Jesus replied. “It is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness in this way.” Then John permitted Him.


## Matthew 3:16 (id: 140003016)

16As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on Him.


## Matthew 3:17 (id: 140003017)

17And a voice from heaven said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!”


## Matthew 4:1 (id: 140004001)

1Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.


## Matthew 4:2 (id: 140004002)

2After fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.


## Matthew 4:3 (id: 140004003)

3The tempter came to Him and said, “If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”


## Matthew 4:4 (id: 140004004)

4But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”


## Matthew 4:5 (id: 140004005)

5Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.


## Matthew 4:6 (id: 140004006)

6“If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written: ‘He will command His angels concerning You, and they will lift You up in their hands, so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.’”


## Matthew 4:7 (id: 140004007)

7Jesus replied, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”


## Matthew 4:8 (id: 140004008)

8Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.


## Matthew 4:9 (id: 140004009)

9“All this I will give You,” he said, “if You will fall down and worship me.”


## Matthew 4:10 (id: 140004010)

10“Away from Me, Satan!” Jesus told him. “For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’”


## Matthew 4:11 (id: 140004011)

11Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him.


## Matthew 4:12 (id: 140004012)

12When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He withdrew to Galilee.


## Matthew 4:13 (id: 140004013)

13Leaving Nazareth, He went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,


## Matthew 4:14 (id: 140004014)

14to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:


## Matthew 4:15 (id: 140004015)

15“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—


## Matthew 4:16 (id: 140004016)

16the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.”


## Matthew 4:17 (id: 140004017)

17From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”


## Matthew 4:18 (id: 140004018)

18As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.


## Matthew 4:19 (id: 140004019)

19“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”


## Matthew 4:20 (id: 140004020)

20And at once they left their nets and followed Him.


## Matthew 4:21 (id: 140004021)

21Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them,


## Matthew 4:22 (id: 140004022)

22and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him.


## Matthew 4:23 (id: 140004023)

23Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.


## Matthew 4:24 (id: 140004024)

24News about Him spread all over Syria, and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering acute pain, the demon\-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and He healed them.


## Matthew 4:25 (id: 140004025)

25Large crowds followed Him, having come from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.


## Matthew 5:1 (id: 140005001)

1When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to Him,


## Matthew 5:2 (id: 140005002)

2and He began to teach them, saying:


## Matthew 5:3 (id: 140005003)

3“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.


## Matthew 5:4 (id: 140005004)

4Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.


## Matthew 5:5 (id: 140005005)

5Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.


## Matthew 5:6 (id: 140005006)

6Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.


## Matthew 5:7 (id: 140005007)

7Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.


## Matthew 5:8 (id: 140005008)

8Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.


## Matthew 5:9 (id: 140005009)

9Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.


## Matthew 5:10 (id: 140005010)

10Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.


## Matthew 5:11 (id: 140005011)

11Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.


## Matthew 5:12 (id: 140005012)

12Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you.


## Matthew 5:13 (id: 140005013)

13You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its savor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.


## Matthew 5:14 (id: 140005014)

14You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.


## Matthew 5:15 (id: 140005015)

15Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they set it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.


## Matthew 5:16 (id: 140005016)

16In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.


## Matthew 5:17 (id: 140005017)

17Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.


## Matthew 5:18 (id: 140005018)

18For I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.


## Matthew 5:19 (id: 140005019)

19So then, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.


## Matthew 5:20 (id: 140005020)

20For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.


## Matthew 5:21 (id: 140005021)

21You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not murder’ and ‘Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’


## Matthew 5:22 (id: 140005022)

22But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca,’ will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the fire of hell.


## Matthew 5:23 (id: 140005023)

23So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,


## Matthew 5:24 (id: 140005024)

24leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.


## Matthew 5:25 (id: 140005025)

25Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.


## Matthew 5:26 (id: 140005026)

26Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.


## Matthew 5:27 (id: 140005027)

27You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’


## Matthew 5:28 (id: 140005028)

28But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.


## Matthew 5:29 (id: 140005029)

29If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.


## Matthew 5:30 (id: 140005030)

30And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to depart into hell.


## Matthew 5:31 (id: 140005031)

31It has also been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’


## Matthew 5:32 (id: 140005032)

32But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, brings adultery upon her. And he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.


## Matthew 5:33 (id: 140005033)

33Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill your vows to the Lord.’


## Matthew 5:34 (id: 140005034)

34But I tell you not to swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne;


## Matthew 5:35 (id: 140005035)

35or by the earth, for it is His footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.


## Matthew 5:36 (id: 140005036)

36Nor should you swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black.


## Matthew 5:37 (id: 140005037)

37Simply let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ Anything more comes from the evil one.


## Matthew 5:38 (id: 140005038)

38You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’


## Matthew 5:39 (id: 140005039)

39But I tell you not to resist an evil person. If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also;


## Matthew 5:40 (id: 140005040)

40if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well;


## Matthew 5:41 (id: 140005041)

41and if someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.


## Matthew 5:42 (id: 140005042)

42Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.


## Matthew 5:43 (id: 140005043)

43You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘Hate your enemy.’


## Matthew 5:44 (id: 140005044)

44But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,


## Matthew 5:45 (id: 140005045)

45that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.


## Matthew 5:46 (id: 140005046)

46If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even tax collectors do the same?


## Matthew 5:47 (id: 140005047)

47And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even Gentiles do the same?


## Matthew 5:48 (id: 140005048)

48Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.


## Matthew 6:1 (id: 140006001)

1“Be careful not to perform your righteous acts before men to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.


## Matthew 6:2 (id: 140006002)

2So when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward.


## Matthew 6:3 (id: 140006003)

3But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,


## Matthew 6:4 (id: 140006004)

4so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.


## Matthew 6:5 (id: 140006005)

5And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward.


## Matthew 6:6 (id: 140006006)

6But when you pray, go into your inner room, shut your door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.


## Matthew 6:7 (id: 140006007)

7And when you pray, do not babble on like pagans, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.


## Matthew 6:8 (id: 140006008)

8Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.


## Matthew 6:9 (id: 140006009)

9So then, this is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.


## Matthew 6:10 (id: 140006010)

10Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.


## Matthew 6:11 (id: 140006011)

11Give us this day our daily bread.


## Matthew 6:12 (id: 140006012)

12And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.


## Matthew 6:13 (id: 140006013)

13And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’


## Matthew 6:14 (id: 140006014)

14For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.


## Matthew 6:15 (id: 140006015)

15But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive yours.


## Matthew 6:16 (id: 140006016)

16When you fast, do not be somber like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward.


## Matthew 6:17 (id: 140006017)

17But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,


## Matthew 6:18 (id: 140006018)

18so that your fasting will not be obvious to men, but only to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.


## Matthew 6:19 (id: 140006019)

19Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.


## Matthew 6:20 (id: 140006020)

20But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.


## Matthew 6:21 (id: 140006021)

21For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.


## Matthew 6:22 (id: 140006022)

22The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.


## Matthew 6:23 (id: 140006023)

23But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!


## Matthew 6:24 (id: 140006024)

24No one can serve two masters: Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.


## Matthew 6:25 (id: 140006025)

25Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?


## Matthew 6:26 (id: 140006026)

26Look at the birds of the air: They do not sow or reap or gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?


## Matthew 6:27 (id: 140006027)

27Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?


## Matthew 6:28 (id: 140006028)

28And why do you worry about clothes? Consider how the lilies of the field grow: They do not labor or spin.


## Matthew 6:29 (id: 140006029)

29Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these.


## Matthew 6:30 (id: 140006030)

30If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?


## Matthew 6:31 (id: 140006031)

31Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’


## Matthew 6:32 (id: 140006032)

32For the Gentiles strive after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.


## Matthew 6:33 (id: 140006033)

33But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.


## Matthew 6:34 (id: 140006034)

34Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.


## Matthew 7:1 (id: 140007001)

1“Do not judge, or you will be judged.


## Matthew 7:2 (id: 140007002)

2For with the same judgment you pronounce, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.


## Matthew 7:3 (id: 140007003)

3Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?


## Matthew 7:4 (id: 140007004)

4How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ while there is still a beam in your own eye?


## Matthew 7:5 (id: 140007005)

5You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.


## Matthew 7:6 (id: 140007006)

6Do not give dogs what is holy; do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.


## Matthew 7:7 (id: 140007007)

7Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.


## Matthew 7:8 (id: 140007008)

8For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.


## Matthew 7:9 (id: 140007009)

9Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?


## Matthew 7:10 (id: 140007010)

10Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?


## Matthew 7:11 (id: 140007011)

11So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!


## Matthew 7:12 (id: 140007012)

12In everything, then, do to others as you would have them do to you. For this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets.


## Matthew 7:13 (id: 140007013)

13Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.


## Matthew 7:14 (id: 140007014)

14But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it.


## Matthew 7:15 (id: 140007015)

15Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.


## Matthew 7:16 (id: 140007016)

16By their fruit you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?


## Matthew 7:17 (id: 140007017)

17Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.


## Matthew 7:18 (id: 140007018)

18A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.


## Matthew 7:19 (id: 140007019)

19Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.


## Matthew 7:20 (id: 140007020)

20So then, by their fruit you will recognize them.


## Matthew 7:21 (id: 140007021)

21Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven.


## Matthew 7:22 (id: 140007022)

22Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’


## Matthew 7:23 (id: 140007023)

23Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’


## Matthew 7:24 (id: 140007024)

24Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.


## Matthew 7:25 (id: 140007025)

25The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock.


## Matthew 7:26 (id: 140007026)

26But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.


## Matthew 7:27 (id: 140007027)

27The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and great was its collapse!”


## Matthew 7:28 (id: 140007028)

28When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were astonished at His teaching,


## Matthew 7:29 (id: 140007029)

29because He taught as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.


## Matthew 8:1 (id: 140008001)

1When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.


## Matthew 8:2 (id: 140008002)

2Suddenly a leper came and knelt before Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”


## Matthew 8:3 (id: 140008003)

3Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.


## Matthew 8:4 (id: 140008004)

4Then Jesus instructed him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift prescribed by Moses, as a testimony to them.”


## Matthew 8:5 (id: 140008005)

5When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came and pleaded with Him,


## Matthew 8:6 (id: 140008006)

6“Lord, my servant lies at home, paralyzed and in terrible agony.”


## Matthew 8:7 (id: 140008007)

7“I will go and heal him,” Jesus replied.


## Matthew 8:8 (id: 140008008)

8The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to have You come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.


## Matthew 8:9 (id: 140008009)

9For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes, and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.”


## Matthew 8:10 (id: 140008010)

10When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those following Him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.


## Matthew 8:11 (id: 140008011)

11I say to you that many will come from the east and the west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.


## Matthew 8:12 (id: 140008012)

12But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”


## Matthew 8:13 (id: 140008013)

13Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! As you have believed, so will it be done for you.” And his servant was healed at that very hour.


## Matthew 8:14 (id: 140008014)

14When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother\-in\-law sick in bed with a fever.


## Matthew 8:15 (id: 140008015)

15So He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve Him.


## Matthew 8:16 (id: 140008016)

16When evening came, many who were demon\-possessed were brought to Jesus, and He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.


## Matthew 8:17 (id: 140008017)

17This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases.”


## Matthew 8:18 (id: 140008018)

18When Jesus saw a large crowd around Him, He gave orders to cross to the other side of the sea.


## Matthew 8:19 (id: 140008019)

19And one of the scribes came to Him and said, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”


## Matthew 8:20 (id: 140008020)

20Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.”


## Matthew 8:21 (id: 140008021)

21Another of His disciples requested, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”


## Matthew 8:22 (id: 140008022)

22But Jesus told him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”


## Matthew 8:23 (id: 140008023)

23When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.


## Matthew 8:24 (id: 140008024)

24Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat was engulfed by the waves. But Jesus was sleeping.


## Matthew 8:25 (id: 140008025)

25The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”


## Matthew 8:26 (id: 140008026)

26“You of little faith,” Jesus replied, “why are you so afraid?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was perfectly calm.


## Matthew 8:27 (id: 140008027)

27The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!”


## Matthew 8:28 (id: 140008028)

28When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, He was met by two demon\-possessed men coming from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.


## Matthew 8:29 (id: 140008029)

29“What do You want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have You come here to torture us before the appointed time?”


## Matthew 8:30 (id: 140008030)

30In the distance a large herd of pigs was feeding.


## Matthew 8:31 (id: 140008031)

31So the demons begged Jesus, “If You drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”


## Matthew 8:32 (id: 140008032)

32“Go!” He told them. So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the waters.


## Matthew 8:33 (id: 140008033)

33Those tending the pigs ran off into the town and reported all this, including the account of the demon\-possessed men.


## Matthew 8:34 (id: 140008034)

34Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.


## Matthew 9:1 (id: 140009001)

1Jesus got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own town.


## Matthew 9:2 (id: 140009002)

2Just then some men brought to Him a paralytic lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.”


## Matthew 9:3 (id: 140009003)

3On seeing this, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”


## Matthew 9:4 (id: 140009004)

4But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, “Why do you harbor evil in your hearts?


## Matthew 9:5 (id: 140009005)

5Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’


## Matthew 9:6 (id: 140009006)

6But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” Then He said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your mat, and go home.”


## Matthew 9:7 (id: 140009007)

7And the man got up and went home.


## Matthew 9:8 (id: 140009008)

8When the crowds saw this, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.


## Matthew 9:9 (id: 140009009)

9As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him, and Matthew got up and followed Him.


## Matthew 9:10 (id: 140009010)

10Later, as Jesus was dining at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Him and His disciples.


## Matthew 9:11 (id: 140009011)

11When the Pharisees saw this, they asked His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”


## Matthew 9:12 (id: 140009012)

12On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.


## Matthew 9:13 (id: 140009013)

13But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”


## Matthew 9:14 (id: 140009014)

14Then John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast so often, but Your disciples do not fast?”


## Matthew 9:15 (id: 140009015)

15Jesus replied, “How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while He is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.


## Matthew 9:16 (id: 140009016)

16No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch will pull away from the garment, and a worse tear will result.


## Matthew 9:17 (id: 140009017)

17Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”


## Matthew 9:18 (id: 140009018)

18While Jesus was saying these things, a synagogue leader came and knelt before Him. “My daughter has just died,” he said. “But come and place Your hand on her, and she will live.”


## Matthew 9:19 (id: 140009019)

19So Jesus got up and went with him, along with His disciples.


## Matthew 9:20 (id: 140009020)

20Suddenly a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak.


## Matthew 9:21 (id: 140009021)

21She said to herself, “If only I touch His cloak, I will be healed.”


## Matthew 9:22 (id: 140009022)

22Jesus turned and saw her. “Take courage, daughter,” He said, “your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed from that very hour.


## Matthew 9:23 (id: 140009023)

23When Jesus entered the house of the synagogue leader, He saw the flute players and the noisy crowd.


## Matthew 9:24 (id: 140009024)

24“Go away,” He told them. “The girl is not dead, but asleep.” And they laughed at Him.


## Matthew 9:25 (id: 140009025)

25After the crowd had been put outside, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.


## Matthew 9:26 (id: 140009026)

26And the news about this spread throughout that region.


## Matthew 9:27 (id: 140009027)

27As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”


## Matthew 9:28 (id: 140009028)

28After Jesus had entered the house, the blind men came to Him. “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” He asked. “Yes, Lord,” they answered.


## Matthew 9:29 (id: 140009029)

29Then He touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith will it be done to you.”


## Matthew 9:30 (id: 140009030)

30And their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them sternly, “See that no one finds out about this!”


## Matthew 9:31 (id: 140009031)

31But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout the land.


## Matthew 9:32 (id: 140009032)

32As they were leaving, a demon\-possessed man who was mute was brought to Jesus.


## Matthew 9:33 (id: 140009033)

33And when the demon had been driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”


## Matthew 9:34 (id: 140009034)

34But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that He drives out demons.”


## Matthew 9:35 (id: 140009035)

35Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness.


## Matthew 9:36 (id: 140009036)

36When He saw the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.


## Matthew 9:37 (id: 140009037)

37Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.


## Matthew 9:38 (id: 140009038)

38Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest.”


## Matthew 10:1 (id: 140010001)

1And calling His twelve disciples to Him, Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and sickness.


## Matthew 10:2 (id: 140010002)

2These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;


## Matthew 10:3 (id: 140010003)

3Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;


## Matthew 10:4 (id: 140010004)

4Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.


## Matthew 10:5 (id: 140010005)

5These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.


## Matthew 10:6 (id: 140010006)

6Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.


## Matthew 10:7 (id: 140010007)

7As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’


## Matthew 10:8 (id: 140010008)

8Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.


## Matthew 10:9 (id: 140010009)

9Do not carry any gold or silver or copper in your belts.


## Matthew 10:10 (id: 140010010)

10Take no bag for the road, or second tunic, or sandals, or staff; for the worker is worthy of his provisions.


## Matthew 10:11 (id: 140010011)

11Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy there and stay at his house until you move on.


## Matthew 10:12 (id: 140010012)

12As you enter the home, greet its occupants.


## Matthew 10:13 (id: 140010013)

13If the home is worthy, let your peace rest on it, but if it is not, let your peace return to you.


## Matthew 10:14 (id: 140010014)

14And if anyone will not welcome you or heed your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.


## Matthew 10:15 (id: 140010015)

15Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.


## Matthew 10:16 (id: 140010016)

16Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.


## Matthew 10:17 (id: 140010017)

17But beware of men, for they will hand you over to their councils and flog you in their synagogues.


## Matthew 10:18 (id: 140010018)

18On My account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.


## Matthew 10:19 (id: 140010019)

19But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to respond or what to say. In that hour you will be given what to say.


## Matthew 10:20 (id: 140010020)

20For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.


## Matthew 10:21 (id: 140010021)

21Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.


## Matthew 10:22 (id: 140010022)

22You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.


## Matthew 10:23 (id: 140010023)

23When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not reach all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.


## Matthew 10:24 (id: 140010024)

24A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.


## Matthew 10:25 (id: 140010025)

25It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!


## Matthew 10:26 (id: 140010026)

26So do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.


## Matthew 10:27 (id: 140010027)

27What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.


## Matthew 10:28 (id: 140010028)

28Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.


## Matthew 10:29 (id: 140010029)

29Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.


## Matthew 10:30 (id: 140010030)

30And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.


## Matthew 10:31 (id: 140010031)

31So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.


## Matthew 10:32 (id: 140010032)

32Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in heaven.


## Matthew 10:33 (id: 140010033)

33But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven.


## Matthew 10:34 (id: 140010034)

34Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.


## Matthew 10:35 (id: 140010035)

35For I have come to turn ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter\-in\-law against her mother\-in\-law.


## Matthew 10:36 (id: 140010036)

36A man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’


## Matthew 10:37 (id: 140010037)

37Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me;


## Matthew 10:38 (id: 140010038)

38and anyone who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.


## Matthew 10:39 (id: 140010039)

39Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.


## Matthew 10:40 (id: 140010040)

40He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me.


## Matthew 10:41 (id: 140010041)

41Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.


## Matthew 10:42 (id: 140010042)

42And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.”


## Matthew 11:1 (id: 140011001)

1After Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.


## Matthew 11:2 (id: 140011002)

2Meanwhile John heard in prison about the works of Christ, and he sent his disciples


## Matthew 11:3 (id: 140011003)

3to ask Him, “Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?”


## Matthew 11:4 (id: 140011004)

4Jesus replied, “Go back and report to John what you hear and see:


## Matthew 11:5 (id: 140011005)

5The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.


## Matthew 11:6 (id: 140011006)

6Blessed is the one who does not fall away on account of Me.”


## Matthew 11:7 (id: 140011007)

7As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?


## Matthew 11:8 (id: 140011008)

8Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothing are found in kings’ palaces.


## Matthew 11:9 (id: 140011009)

9What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.


## Matthew 11:10 (id: 140011010)

10This is the one about whom it is written: ‘Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You, who will prepare Your way before You.’


## Matthew 11:11 (id: 140011011)

11Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.


## Matthew 11:12 (id: 140011012)

12From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subject to violence, and the violent lay claim to it.


## Matthew 11:13 (id: 140011013)

13For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.


## Matthew 11:14 (id: 140011014)

14And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.


## Matthew 11:15 (id: 140011015)

15He who has ears, let him hear.


## Matthew 11:16 (id: 140011016)

16To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others:


## Matthew 11:17 (id: 140011017)

17‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’


## Matthew 11:18 (id: 140011018)

18For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’


## Matthew 11:19 (id: 140011019)

19The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her actions.”


## Matthew 11:20 (id: 140011020)

20Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.


## Matthew 11:21 (id: 140011021)

21“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.


## Matthew 11:22 (id: 140011022)

22But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.


## Matthew 11:23 (id: 140011023)

23And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.


## Matthew 11:24 (id: 140011024)

24But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”


## Matthew 11:25 (id: 140011025)

25At that time Jesus declared, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.


## Matthew 11:26 (id: 140011026)

26Yes, Father, for this was well\-pleasing in Your sight.


## Matthew 11:27 (id: 140011027)

27All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.


## Matthew 11:28 (id: 140011028)

28Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.


## Matthew 11:29 (id: 140011029)

29Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.


## Matthew 11:30 (id: 140011030)

30For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”


## Matthew 12:1 (id: 140012001)

1At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat them.


## Matthew 12:2 (id: 140012002)

2When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”


## Matthew 12:3 (id: 140012003)

3Jesus replied, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?


## Matthew 12:4 (id: 140012004)

4He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, but only for the priests.


## Matthew 12:5 (id: 140012005)

5Or haven’t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and yet are innocent?


## Matthew 12:6 (id: 140012006)

6But I tell you that One greater than the temple is here.


## Matthew 12:7 (id: 140012007)

7If only you had known the meaning of ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent.


## Matthew 12:8 (id: 140012008)

8For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”


## Matthew 12:9 (id: 140012009)

9Moving on from there, Jesus entered their synagogue,


## Matthew 12:10 (id: 140012010)

10and a man with a withered hand was there. In order to accuse Jesus, they asked Him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”


## Matthew 12:11 (id: 140012011)

11He replied, “If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out?


## Matthew 12:12 (id: 140012012)

12How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”


## Matthew 12:13 (id: 140012013)

13Then Jesus said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and it was restored to full use, just like the other.


## Matthew 12:14 (id: 140012014)

14But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.


## Matthew 12:15 (id: 140012015)

15Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them all,


## Matthew 12:16 (id: 140012016)

16warning them not to make Him known.


## Matthew 12:17 (id: 140012017)

17This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:


## Matthew 12:18 (id: 140012018)

18“Here is My Servant, whom I have chosen, My beloved, in whom My soul delights. I will put My Spirit on Him, and He will proclaim justice to the nations.


## Matthew 12:19 (id: 140012019)

19He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear His voice in the streets.


## Matthew 12:20 (id: 140012020)

20A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not extinguish, till He leads justice to victory.


## Matthew 12:21 (id: 140012021)

21In His name the nations will put their hope.”


## Matthew 12:22 (id: 140012022)

22Then a demon\-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed the man so that he could speak and see.


## Matthew 12:23 (id: 140012023)

23The crowds were astounded and asked, “Could this be the Son of David?”


## Matthew 12:24 (id: 140012024)

24But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “Only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, does this man drive out demons.”


## Matthew 12:25 (id: 140012025)

25Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.


## Matthew 12:26 (id: 140012026)

26If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?


## Matthew 12:27 (id: 140012027)

27And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.


## Matthew 12:28 (id: 140012028)

28But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.


## Matthew 12:29 (id: 140012029)

29Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and steal his possessions, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.


## Matthew 12:30 (id: 140012030)

30He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.


## Matthew 12:31 (id: 140012031)

31Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.


## Matthew 12:32 (id: 140012032)

32Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the one to come.


## Matthew 12:33 (id: 140012033)

33Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is known by its fruit.


## Matthew 12:34 (id: 140012034)

34You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.


## Matthew 12:35 (id: 140012035)

35The good man brings good things out of his good store of treasure, and the evil man brings evil things out of his evil store of treasure.


## Matthew 12:36 (id: 140012036)

36But I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.


## Matthew 12:37 (id: 140012037)

37For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”


## Matthew 12:38 (id: 140012038)

38Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”


## Matthew 12:39 (id: 140012039)

39Jesus replied, “A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.


## Matthew 12:40 (id: 140012040)

40For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.


## Matthew 12:41 (id: 140012041)

41The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than Jonah is here.


## Matthew 12:42 (id: 140012042)

42The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here.


## Matthew 12:43 (id: 140012043)

43When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.


## Matthew 12:44 (id: 140012044)

44Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ On its return, it finds the house vacant, swept clean, and put in order.


## Matthew 12:45 (id: 140012045)

45Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and dwell there. And the final plight of that man is worse than the first. So will it be with this wicked generation.”


## Matthew 12:46 (id: 140012046)

46While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, His mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to Him.


## Matthew 12:47 (id: 140012047)

47Someone told Him, “Look, Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to You.”


## Matthew 12:48 (id: 140012048)

48But Jesus replied, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?”


## Matthew 12:49 (id: 140012049)

49Pointing to His disciples, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers.


## Matthew 12:50 (id: 140012050)

50For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”


## Matthew 13:1 (id: 140013001)

1That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.


## Matthew 13:2 (id: 140013002)

2Such large crowds gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore.


## Matthew 13:3 (id: 140013003)

3And He told them many things in parables, saying, “A farmer went out to sow his seed.


## Matthew 13:4 (id: 140013004)

4And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.


## Matthew 13:5 (id: 140013005)

5Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.


## Matthew 13:6 (id: 140013006)

6But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.


## Matthew 13:7 (id: 140013007)

7Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings.


## Matthew 13:8 (id: 140013008)

8Still other seed fell on good soil and produced a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.


## Matthew 13:9 (id: 140013009)

9He who has ears, let him hear.”


## Matthew 13:10 (id: 140013010)

10Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do You speak to the people in parables?”


## Matthew 13:11 (id: 140013011)

11He replied, “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.


## Matthew 13:12 (id: 140013012)

12Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.


## Matthew 13:13 (id: 140013013)

13This is why I speak to them in parables: ‘Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.’


## Matthew 13:14 (id: 140013014)

14In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled: ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.


## Matthew 13:15 (id: 140013015)

15For this people’s heart has grown callous; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.’


## Matthew 13:16 (id: 140013016)

16But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.


## Matthew 13:17 (id: 140013017)

17For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.


## Matthew 13:18 (id: 140013018)

18Consider, then, the parable of the sower:


## Matthew 13:19 (id: 140013019)

19When anyone hears the message of the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.


## Matthew 13:20 (id: 140013020)

20The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.


## Matthew 13:21 (id: 140013021)

21But since he has no root, he remains for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.


## Matthew 13:22 (id: 140013022)

22The seed sown among the thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.


## Matthew 13:23 (id: 140013023)

23But the seed sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and produces a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.”


## Matthew 13:24 (id: 140013024)

24Jesus put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.


## Matthew 13:25 (id: 140013025)

25But while everyone was asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and slipped away.


## Matthew 13:26 (id: 140013026)

26When the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds also appeared.


## Matthew 13:27 (id: 140013027)

27The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’


## Matthew 13:28 (id: 140013028)

28‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. So the servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’


## Matthew 13:29 (id: 140013029)

29‘No,’ he said, ‘if you pull the weeds now, you might uproot the wheat with them.


## Matthew 13:30 (id: 140013030)

30Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat into my barn.’”


## Matthew 13:31 (id: 140013031)

31He put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.


## Matthew 13:32 (id: 140013032)

32Although it is the smallest of all seeds, yet it grows into the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”


## Matthew 13:33 (id: 140013033)

33He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.”


## Matthew 13:34 (id: 140013034)

34Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable.


## Matthew 13:35 (id: 140013035)

35So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.”


## Matthew 13:36 (id: 140013036)

36Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”


## Matthew 13:37 (id: 140013037)

37He replied, “The One who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.


## Matthew 13:38 (id: 140013038)

38The field is the world, and the good seed represents the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,


## Matthew 13:39 (id: 140013039)

39and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.


## Matthew 13:40 (id: 140013040)

40As the weeds are collected and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age.


## Matthew 13:41 (id: 140013041)

41The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom every cause of sin and all who practice lawlessness.


## Matthew 13:42 (id: 140013042)

42And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.


## Matthew 13:43 (id: 140013043)

43Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.


## Matthew 13:44 (id: 140013044)

44The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and in his joy he went and sold all he had and bought that field.


## Matthew 13:45 (id: 140013045)

45Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.


## Matthew 13:46 (id: 140013046)

46When he found one very precious pearl, he went away and sold all he had and bought it.


## Matthew 13:47 (id: 140013047)

47Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and caught all kinds of fish.


## Matthew 13:48 (id: 140013048)

48When it was full, the men pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into containers, but threw the bad away.


## Matthew 13:49 (id: 140013049)

49So will it be at the end of the age: The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous


## Matthew 13:50 (id: 140013050)

50and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.


## Matthew 13:51 (id: 140013051)

51Have you understood all these things?” “Yes,” they answered.


## Matthew 13:52 (id: 140013052)

52Then He told them, “For this reason, every scribe who has been discipled in the kingdom of heaven is like a homeowner who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”


## Matthew 13:53 (id: 140013053)

53When Jesus had finished these parables, He withdrew from that place.


## Matthew 13:54 (id: 140013054)

54Coming to His hometown, He taught the people in their synagogue, and they were astonished. “Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?” they asked.


## Matthew 13:55 (id: 140013055)

55“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t His mother’s name Mary, and aren’t His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?


## Matthew 13:56 (id: 140013056)

56Aren’t all His sisters with us as well? Where then did this man get all these things?”


## Matthew 13:57 (id: 140013057)

57And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, “Only in his hometown and in his own household is a prophet without honor.”


## Matthew 13:58 (id: 140013058)

58And He did not do many miracles there, because of their unbelief.


## Matthew 14:1 (id: 140014001)

1At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus


## Matthew 14:2 (id: 140014002)

2and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”


## Matthew 14:3 (id: 140014003)

3Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,


## Matthew 14:4 (id: 140014004)

4because John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”


## Matthew 14:5 (id: 140014005)

5Although Herod wanted to kill John, he was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.


## Matthew 14:6 (id: 140014006)

6On Herod’s birthday, however, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod


## Matthew 14:7 (id: 140014007)

7so much that he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she asked.


## Matthew 14:8 (id: 140014008)

8Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”


## Matthew 14:9 (id: 140014009)

9The king was grieved, but because of his oaths and his guests, he ordered that her wish be granted


## Matthew 14:10 (id: 140014010)

10and sent to have John beheaded in the prison.


## Matthew 14:11 (id: 140014011)

11John’s head was brought in on a platter and presented to the girl, who carried it to her mother.


## Matthew 14:12 (id: 140014012)

12Then John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. And they went and informed Jesus.


## Matthew 14:13 (id: 140014013)

13When Jesus heard about John, He withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. But the crowds found out about it and followed Him on foot from the towns.


## Matthew 14:14 (id: 140014014)

14When He stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them and healed their sick.


## Matthew 14:15 (id: 140014015)

15When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”


## Matthew 14:16 (id: 140014016)

16“They do not need to go away,” Jesus replied. “You give them something to eat.”


## Matthew 14:17 (id: 140014017)

17“We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.


## Matthew 14:18 (id: 140014018)

18“Bring them here to Me,” Jesus said.


## Matthew 14:19 (id: 140014019)

19And He directed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.


## Matthew 14:20 (id: 140014020)

20They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.


## Matthew 14:21 (id: 140014021)

21About five thousand men were fed, besides women and children.


## Matthew 14:22 (id: 140014022)

22Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.


## Matthew 14:23 (id: 140014023)

23After He had dismissed them, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone,


## Matthew 14:24 (id: 140014024)

24but the boat was already far from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.


## Matthew 14:25 (id: 140014025)

25During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.


## Matthew 14:26 (id: 140014026)

26When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear.


## Matthew 14:27 (id: 140014027)

27But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”


## Matthew 14:28 (id: 140014028)

28“Lord, if it is You,” Peter replied, “command me to come to You on the water.”


## Matthew 14:29 (id: 140014029)

29“Come,” said Jesus. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.


## Matthew 14:30 (id: 140014030)

30But when he saw the strength of the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”


## Matthew 14:31 (id: 140014031)

31Immediately Jesus reached out His hand and took hold of Peter. “You of little faith,” He said, “why did you doubt?”


## Matthew 14:32 (id: 140014032)

32And when they had climbed back into the boat, the wind died down.


## Matthew 14:33 (id: 140014033)

33Then those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!”


## Matthew 14:34 (id: 140014034)

34When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.


## Matthew 14:35 (id: 140014035)

35And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding region. People brought all the sick to Him


## Matthew 14:36 (id: 140014036)

36and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.


## Matthew 15:1 (id: 140015001)

1Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,


## Matthew 15:2 (id: 140015002)

2“Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.”


## Matthew 15:3 (id: 140015003)

3Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?


## Matthew 15:4 (id: 140015004)

4For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’


## Matthew 15:5 (id: 140015005)

5But you say that if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is a gift devoted to God,’


## Matthew 15:6 (id: 140015006)

6he need not honor his father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.


## Matthew 15:7 (id: 140015007)

7You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you:


## Matthew 15:8 (id: 140015008)

8‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.


## Matthew 15:9 (id: 140015009)

9They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’”


## Matthew 15:10 (id: 140015010)

10Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “Listen and understand.


## Matthew 15:11 (id: 140015011)

11A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.”


## Matthew 15:12 (id: 140015012)

12Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”


## Matthew 15:13 (id: 140015013)

13But Jesus replied, “Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by its roots.


## Matthew 15:14 (id: 140015014)

14Disregard them! They are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”


## Matthew 15:15 (id: 140015015)

15Peter said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”


## Matthew 15:16 (id: 140015016)

16“Do you still not understand?” Jesus asked.


## Matthew 15:17 (id: 140015017)

17“Do you not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated?


## Matthew 15:18 (id: 140015018)

18But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a man.


## Matthew 15:19 (id: 140015019)

19For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.


## Matthew 15:20 (id: 140015020)

20These are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.”


## Matthew 15:21 (id: 140015021)

21Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.


## Matthew 15:22 (id: 140015022)

22And a Canaanite woman from that region came to Him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.”


## Matthew 15:23 (id: 140015023)

23But Jesus did not answer a word. So His disciples came and urged Him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”


## Matthew 15:24 (id: 140015024)

24He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”


## Matthew 15:25 (id: 140015025)

25The woman came and knelt before Him. “Lord, help me!” she said.


## Matthew 15:26 (id: 140015026)

26But Jesus replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”


## Matthew 15:27 (id: 140015027)

27“Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”


## Matthew 15:28 (id: 140015028)

28“O woman,” Jesus answered, “your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.


## Matthew 15:29 (id: 140015029)

29Moving on from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountain and sat down.


## Matthew 15:30 (id: 140015030)

30Large crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at His feet, and He healed them.


## Matthew 15:31 (id: 140015031)

31The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.


## Matthew 15:32 (id: 140015032)

32Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along the way.”


## Matthew 15:33 (id: 140015033)

33The disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large crowd?”


## Matthew 15:34 (id: 140015034)

34“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”


## Matthew 15:35 (id: 140015035)

35And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground.


## Matthew 15:36 (id: 140015036)

36Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.


## Matthew 15:37 (id: 140015037)

37They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.


## Matthew 15:38 (id: 140015038)

38A total of four thousand men were fed, besides women and children.


## Matthew 15:39 (id: 140015039)

39After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.


## Matthew 16:1 (id: 140016001)

1Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came and tested Jesus by asking Him to show them a sign from heaven.


## Matthew 16:2 (id: 140016002)

2But He replied, “When evening comes, you say, ‘The weather will be fair, for the sky is red,’


## Matthew 16:3 (id: 140016003)

3and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but not the signs of the times.


## Matthew 16:4 (id: 140016004)

4A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.” Then He left them and went away.


## Matthew 16:5 (id: 140016005)

5When they crossed to the other side, the disciples forgot to take bread.


## Matthew 16:6 (id: 140016006)

6“Watch out!” Jesus told them. “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”


## Matthew 16:7 (id: 140016007)

7They discussed this among themselves and concluded, “It is because we did not bring any bread.”


## Matthew 16:8 (id: 140016008)

8Aware of their conversation, Jesus said, “You of little faith, why are you debating among yourselves about having no bread?


## Matthew 16:9 (id: 140016009)

9Do you still not understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?


## Matthew 16:10 (id: 140016010)

10Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?


## Matthew 16:11 (id: 140016011)

11How do you not understand that I was not telling you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”


## Matthew 16:12 (id: 140016012)

12Then they understood that He was not telling them to beware of the leaven used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.


## Matthew 16:13 (id: 140016013)

13When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, He questioned His disciples: “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”


## Matthew 16:14 (id: 140016014)

14They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”


## Matthew 16:15 (id: 140016015)

15“But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?”


## Matthew 16:16 (id: 140016016)

16Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”


## Matthew 16:17 (id: 140016017)

17Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by My Father in heaven.


## Matthew 16:18 (id: 140016018)

18And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.


## Matthew 16:19 (id: 140016019)

19I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”


## Matthew 16:20 (id: 140016020)

20Then He admonished the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.


## Matthew 16:21 (id: 140016021)

21From that time on Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.


## Matthew 16:22 (id: 140016022)

22Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. “Far be it from You, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to You!”


## Matthew 16:23 (id: 140016023)

23But Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me. For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.”


## Matthew 16:24 (id: 140016024)

24Then Jesus told His disciples, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.


## Matthew 16:25 (id: 140016025)

25For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.


## Matthew 16:26 (id: 140016026)

26What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?


## Matthew 16:27 (id: 140016027)

27For the Son of Man will come in His Father’s glory with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to what he has done.


## Matthew 16:28 (id: 140016028)

28Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”


## Matthew 17:1 (id: 140017001)

1After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.


## Matthew 17:2 (id: 140017002)

2There He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light.


## Matthew 17:3 (id: 140017003)

3Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them, talking with Jesus.


## Matthew 17:4 (id: 140017004)

4Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, I will put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”


## Matthew 17:5 (id: 140017005)

5While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him!”


## Matthew 17:6 (id: 140017006)

6When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown in terror.


## Matthew 17:7 (id: 140017007)

7Then Jesus came over and touched them. “Get up,” He said. “Do not be afraid.”


## Matthew 17:8 (id: 140017008)

8And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.


## Matthew 17:9 (id: 140017009)

9As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Do not tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”


## Matthew 17:10 (id: 140017010)

10The disciples asked Him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”


## Matthew 17:11 (id: 140017011)

11Jesus replied, “Elijah does indeed come, and he will restore all things.


## Matthew 17:12 (id: 140017012)

12But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him whatever they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.”


## Matthew 17:13 (id: 140017013)

13Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them about John the Baptist.


## Matthew 17:14 (id: 140017014)

14When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus and knelt before Him.


## Matthew 17:15 (id: 140017015)

15“Lord, have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and is suffering terribly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.


## Matthew 17:16 (id: 140017016)

16I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not heal him.”


## Matthew 17:17 (id: 140017017)

17“O unbelieving and perverse generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to Me.”


## Matthew 17:18 (id: 140017018)

18Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment.


## Matthew 17:19 (id: 140017019)

19Afterward the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”


## Matthew 17:20 (id: 140017020)

20“Because you have so little faith,” He answered. “For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”


## Matthew 17:22 (id: 140017022)

22When they gathered together in Galilee, Jesus told them, “The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.


## Matthew 17:23 (id: 140017023)

23They will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised to life.” And the disciples were deeply grieved.


## Matthew 17:24 (id: 140017024)

24After they had arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two\-drachma tax came to Peter and asked, “Does your Teacher pay the two drachmas?”


## Matthew 17:25 (id: 140017025)

25“Yes,” he answered. When Peter entered the house, Jesus preempted him. “What do you think, Simon?” He asked. “From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs and taxes: from their own sons, or from others?”


## Matthew 17:26 (id: 140017026)

26“From others,” Peter answered. “Then the sons are exempt,” Jesus said to him.


## Matthew 17:27 (id: 140017027)

27“But so that we may not offend them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the first fish you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a four\-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for My tax and yours.”


## Matthew 18:1 (id: 140018001)

1At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”


## Matthew 18:2 (id: 140018002)

2Jesus invited a little child to stand among them.


## Matthew 18:3 (id: 140018003)

3“Truly I tell you,” He said, “unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.


## Matthew 18:4 (id: 140018004)

4Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.


## Matthew 18:5 (id: 140018005)

5And whoever welcomes a little child like this in My name welcomes Me.


## Matthew 18:6 (id: 140018006)

6But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.


## Matthew 18:7 (id: 140018007)

7Woe to the world for the causes of sin. These stumbling blocks must come, but woe to the man through whom they come!


## Matthew 18:8 (id: 140018008)

8If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.


## Matthew 18:9 (id: 140018009)

9And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.


## Matthew 18:10 (id: 140018010)

10See that you do not look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of My Father in heaven.


## Matthew 18:12 (id: 140018012)

12What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety\-nine on the hills and go out to search for the one that is lost?


## Matthew 18:13 (id: 140018013)

13And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices more over that one sheep than over the ninety\-nine that did not go astray.


## Matthew 18:14 (id: 140018014)

14In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.


## Matthew 18:15 (id: 140018015)

15If your brother sins against you, go and confront him privately. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.


## Matthew 18:16 (id: 140018016)

16But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’


## Matthew 18:17 (id: 140018017)

17If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, regard him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.


## Matthew 18:18 (id: 140018018)

18Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.


## Matthew 18:19 (id: 140018019)

19Again, I tell you truly that if two of you on the earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by My Father in heaven.


## Matthew 18:20 (id: 140018020)

20For where two or three gather together in My name, there am I with them.”


## Matthew 18:21 (id: 140018021)

21Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother who sins against me? Up to seven times?”


## Matthew 18:22 (id: 140018022)

22Jesus answered, “I tell you, not just seven times, but seventy\-seven times!


## Matthew 18:23 (id: 140018023)

23Because of this, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.


## Matthew 18:24 (id: 140018024)

24As he began the settlements, a debtor owing ten thousand talents was brought to him.


## Matthew 18:25 (id: 140018025)

25Since the man was unable to pay, the master ordered that he be sold to pay his debt, along with his wife and children and everything he owned.


## Matthew 18:26 (id: 140018026)

26Then the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Have patience with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’


## Matthew 18:27 (id: 140018027)

27His master had compassion on him, forgave his debt, and released him.


## Matthew 18:28 (id: 140018028)

28But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back what you owe me!’


## Matthew 18:29 (id: 140018029)

29So his fellow servant fell down and begged him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.’


## Matthew 18:30 (id: 140018030)

30But he refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay his debt.


## Matthew 18:31 (id: 140018031)

31When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and recounted all of this to their master.


## Matthew 18:32 (id: 140018032)

32Then the master summoned him and said, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave all your debt because you begged me.


## Matthew 18:33 (id: 140018033)

33Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had on you?’


## Matthew 18:34 (id: 140018034)

34In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should repay all that he owed.


## Matthew 18:35 (id: 140018035)

35That is how My heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.”


## Matthew 19:1 (id: 140019001)

1When Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.


## Matthew 19:2 (id: 140019002)

2Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.


## Matthew 19:3 (id: 140019003)

3Then some Pharisees came and tested Him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”


## Matthew 19:4 (id: 140019004)

4Jesus answered, “Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’


## Matthew 19:5 (id: 140019005)

5and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’?


## Matthew 19:6 (id: 140019006)

6So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.”


## Matthew 19:7 (id: 140019007)

7“Why then,” they asked, “did Moses order a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?”


## Matthew 19:8 (id: 140019008)

8Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart. But it was not this way from the beginning.


## Matthew 19:9 (id: 140019009)

9Now I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”


## Matthew 19:10 (id: 140019010)

10His disciples said to Him, “If this is the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.”


## Matthew 19:11 (id: 140019011)

11“Not everyone can accept this word,” He replied, “but only those to whom it has been given.


## Matthew 19:12 (id: 140019012)

12For there are eunuchs who were born that way; others were made that way by men; and still others live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”


## Matthew 19:13 (id: 140019013)

13Then little children were brought to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them and pray for them. And the disciples rebuked those who brought them.


## Matthew 19:14 (id: 140019014)

14But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”


## Matthew 19:15 (id: 140019015)

15And after He had placed His hands on them, He went on from there.


## Matthew 19:16 (id: 140019016)

16Just then a man came up to Jesus and inquired, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?”


## Matthew 19:17 (id: 140019017)

17“Why do you ask Me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”


## Matthew 19:18 (id: 140019018)

18“Which ones?” the man asked. Jesus answered, “‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,


## Matthew 19:19 (id: 140019019)

19honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.’”


## Matthew 19:20 (id: 140019020)

20“All these I have kept,” said the young man. “What do I still lack?”


## Matthew 19:21 (id: 140019021)

21Jesus told him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”


## Matthew 19:22 (id: 140019022)

22When the young man heard this, he went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth.


## Matthew 19:23 (id: 140019023)

23Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.


## Matthew 19:24 (id: 140019024)

24Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”


## Matthew 19:25 (id: 140019025)

25When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”


## Matthew 19:26 (id: 140019026)

26Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”


## Matthew 19:27 (id: 140019027)

27“Look,” Peter replied, “we have left everything to follow You. What then will there be for us?”


## Matthew 19:28 (id: 140019028)

28Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, in the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.


## Matthew 19:29 (id: 140019029)

29And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for the sake of My name will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.


## Matthew 19:30 (id: 140019030)

30But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.


## Matthew 20:1 (id: 140020001)

1“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.


## Matthew 20:2 (id: 140020002)

2He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.


## Matthew 20:3 (id: 140020003)

3About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.


## Matthew 20:4 (id: 140020004)

4‘You also go into my vineyard,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you whatever is right.’


## Matthew 20:5 (id: 140020005)

5So they went. He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing.


## Matthew 20:6 (id: 140020006)

6About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’ he asked.


## Matthew 20:7 (id: 140020007)

7‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. So he told them, ‘You also go into my vineyard.’


## Matthew 20:8 (id: 140020008)

8When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and moving on to the first.’


## Matthew 20:9 (id: 140020009)

9The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.


## Matthew 20:10 (id: 140020010)

10So when the original workers came, they assumed they would receive more. But each of them also received a denarius.


## Matthew 20:11 (id: 140020011)

11On receiving their pay, they began to grumble against the landowner.


## Matthew 20:12 (id: 140020012)

12‘These men who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.’


## Matthew 20:13 (id: 140020013)

13But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Did you not agree with me on one denarius?


## Matthew 20:14 (id: 140020014)

14Take your pay and go. I want to give this last man the same as I gave you.


## Matthew 20:15 (id: 140020015)

15Do I not have the right to do as I please with what is mine? Or are you envious because I am generous?’


## Matthew 20:16 (id: 140020016)

16So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”


## Matthew 20:17 (id: 140020017)

17As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside and said,


## Matthew 20:18 (id: 140020018)

18“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn Him to death


## Matthew 20:19 (id: 140020019)

19and will deliver Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. And on the third day He will be raised to life.”


## Matthew 20:20 (id: 140020020)

20Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and knelt down to make a request of Him.


## Matthew 20:21 (id: 140020021)

21“What do you want?” He inquired. She answered, “Declare that in Your kingdom one of these two sons of mine may sit at Your right hand, and the other at Your left.”


## Matthew 20:22 (id: 140020022)

22“You do not know what you are asking,” Jesus replied. “Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?” “We can,” the brothers answered.


## Matthew 20:23 (id: 140020023)

23“You will indeed drink My cup,” Jesus said. “But to sit at My right or left is not Mine to grant. These seats belong to those for whom My Father has prepared them.”


## Matthew 20:24 (id: 140020024)

24When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.


## Matthew 20:25 (id: 140020025)

25But Jesus called them aside and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise authority over them.


## Matthew 20:26 (id: 140020026)

26It shall not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,


## Matthew 20:27 (id: 140020027)

27and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave—


## Matthew 20:28 (id: 140020028)

28just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”


## Matthew 20:29 (id: 140020029)

29As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.


## Matthew 20:30 (id: 140020030)

30And there were two blind men sitting beside the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”


## Matthew 20:31 (id: 140020031)

31The crowd admonished them to be silent, but they cried out all the louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”


## Matthew 20:32 (id: 140020032)

32Jesus stopped and called them. “What do you want Me to do for you?” He asked.


## Matthew 20:33 (id: 140020033)

33“Lord,” they answered, “let our eyes be opened.”


## Matthew 20:34 (id: 140020034)

34Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and at once they received their sight and followed Him.


## Matthew 21:1 (id: 140021001)

1As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two disciples,


## Matthew 21:2 (id: 140021002)

2saying to them, “Go into the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to Me.


## Matthew 21:3 (id: 140021003)

3If anyone questions you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”


## Matthew 21:4 (id: 140021004)

4This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:


## Matthew 21:5 (id: 140021005)

5“Say to the Daughter of Zion, ‘See, your King comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”


## Matthew 21:6 (id: 140021006)

6So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.


## Matthew 21:7 (id: 140021007)

7They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.


## Matthew 21:8 (id: 140021008)

8A massive crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.


## Matthew 21:9 (id: 140021009)

9The crowds that went ahead of Him and those that followed were shouting: “Hosanna to the Son of David!” “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Hosanna in the highest!”


## Matthew 21:10 (id: 140021010)

10When Jesus had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?”


## Matthew 21:11 (id: 140021011)

11The crowds replied, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”


## Matthew 21:12 (id: 140021012)

12Then Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.


## Matthew 21:13 (id: 140021013)

13And He declared to them, “It is written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer.’ But you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’”


## Matthew 21:14 (id: 140021014)

14The blind and the lame came to Him at the temple, and He healed them.


## Matthew 21:15 (id: 140021015)

15But the chief priests and scribes were indignant when they saw the wonders He performed and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David!”


## Matthew 21:16 (id: 140021016)

16“Do You hear what these children are saying?” they asked. “Yes,” Jesus answered. “Have you never read: ‘From the mouths of children and infants You have ordained praise’?”


## Matthew 21:17 (id: 140021017)

17Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where He spent the night.


## Matthew 21:18 (id: 140021018)

18In the morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, He was hungry.


## Matthew 21:19 (id: 140021019)

19Seeing a fig tree by the road, He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. “May you never bear fruit again!” He said. And immediately the tree withered.


## Matthew 21:20 (id: 140021020)

20When the disciples saw this, they marveled and asked, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”


## Matthew 21:21 (id: 140021021)

21“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.


## Matthew 21:22 (id: 140021022)

22If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”


## Matthew 21:23 (id: 140021023)

23When Jesus returned to the temple courts and began to teach, the chief priests and elders of the people came up to Him. “By what authority are You doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave You this authority?”


## Matthew 21:24 (id: 140021024)

24“I will also ask you one question,” Jesus replied, “and if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.


## Matthew 21:25 (id: 140021025)

25What was the source of John’s baptism? Was it from heaven or from men?” They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’


## Matthew 21:26 (id: 140021026)

26But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the people, for they all regard John as a prophet.”


## Matthew 21:27 (id: 140021027)

27So they answered, “We do not know.” And Jesus replied, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.


## Matthew 21:28 (id: 140021028)

28But what do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first one and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’


## Matthew 21:29 (id: 140021029)

29‘I will not,’ he replied. But later he changed his mind and went.


## Matthew 21:30 (id: 140021030)

30Then the man went to the second son and told him the same thing. ‘I will, sir,’ he said. But he did not go.


## Matthew 21:31 (id: 140021031)

31Which of the two did the will of his father?” “The first,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you.


## Matthew 21:32 (id: 140021032)

32For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.


## Matthew 21:33 (id: 140021033)

33Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he rented it out to some tenants and went away on a journey.


## Matthew 21:34 (id: 140021034)

34When the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit.


## Matthew 21:35 (id: 140021035)

35But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.


## Matthew 21:36 (id: 140021036)

36Again, he sent other servants, more than the first group. But the tenants did the same to them.


## Matthew 21:37 (id: 140021037)

37Finally, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.


## Matthew 21:38 (id: 140021038)

38But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take his inheritance.’


## Matthew 21:39 (id: 140021039)

39So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.


## Matthew 21:40 (id: 140021040)

40Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?”


## Matthew 21:41 (id: 140021041)

41“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and will rent out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the fruit at harvest time.”


## Matthew 21:42 (id: 140021042)

42Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?


## Matthew 21:43 (id: 140021043)

43Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.


## Matthew 21:44 (id: 140021044)

44He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.”


## Matthew 21:45 (id: 140021045)

45When the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they knew that Jesus was speaking about them.


## Matthew 21:46 (id: 140021046)

46Although they wanted to arrest Him, they were afraid of the crowds, because the people regarded Him as a prophet.


## Matthew 22:1 (id: 140022001)

1Once again, Jesus spoke to them in parables:


## Matthew 22:2 (id: 140022002)

2“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.


## Matthew 22:3 (id: 140022003)

3He sent his servants to call those he had invited to the banquet, but they refused to come.


## Matthew 22:4 (id: 140022004)

4Again, he sent other servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’


## Matthew 22:5 (id: 140022005)

5But they paid no attention and went away, one to his field, another to his business.


## Matthew 22:6 (id: 140022006)

6The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.


## Matthew 22:7 (id: 140022007)

7The king was enraged, and he sent his troops to destroy those murderers and burn their city.


## Matthew 22:8 (id: 140022008)

8Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited were not worthy.


## Matthew 22:9 (id: 140022009)

9Go therefore to the crossroads and invite to the banquet as many as you can find.’


## Matthew 22:10 (id: 140022010)

10So the servants went out into the streets and gathered everyone they could find, both evil and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.


## Matthew 22:11 (id: 140022011)

11But when the king came in to see the guests, he spotted a man who was not dressed in wedding clothes.


## Matthew 22:12 (id: 140022012)

12‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But the man was speechless.


## Matthew 22:13 (id: 140022013)

13Then the king told the servants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’


## Matthew 22:14 (id: 140022014)

14For many are called, but few are chosen.”


## Matthew 22:15 (id: 140022015)

15Then the Pharisees went out and conspired to trap Jesus in His words.


## Matthew 22:16 (id: 140022016)

16They sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that You are honest and that You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You seek favor from no one, because You pay no attention to external appearance.


## Matthew 22:17 (id: 140022017)

17So tell us what You think: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”


## Matthew 22:18 (id: 140022018)

18But Jesus knew their evil intent and said, “You hypocrites, why are you testing Me?


## Matthew 22:19 (id: 140022019)

19Show Me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought Him a denarius.


## Matthew 22:20 (id: 140022020)

20“Whose image is this,” He asked, “and whose inscription?”


## Matthew 22:21 (id: 140022021)

21“Caesar’s,” they answered. So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”


## Matthew 22:22 (id: 140022022)

22And when they heard this, they were amazed. So they left Him and went away.


## Matthew 22:23 (id: 140022023)

23That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned Him.


## Matthew 22:24 (id: 140022024)

24“Teacher,” they said, “Moses declared that if a man dies without having children, his brother is to marry the widow and raise up offspring for him.


## Matthew 22:25 (id: 140022025)

25Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died without having children. So he left his wife to his brother.


## Matthew 22:26 (id: 140022026)

26The same thing happened to the second and third brothers, down to the seventh.


## Matthew 22:27 (id: 140022027)

27And last of all, the woman died.


## Matthew 22:28 (id: 140022028)

28In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For all of them were married to her.”


## Matthew 22:29 (id: 140022029)

29Jesus answered, “You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.


## Matthew 22:30 (id: 140022030)

30In the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven.


## Matthew 22:31 (id: 140022031)

31But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said to you:


## Matthew 22:32 (id: 140022032)

32‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”


## Matthew 22:33 (id: 140022033)

33When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.


## Matthew 22:34 (id: 140022034)

34And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they themselves gathered together.


## Matthew 22:35 (id: 140022035)

35One of them, an expert in the law, tested Him with a question:


## Matthew 22:36 (id: 140022036)

36“Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?”


## Matthew 22:37 (id: 140022037)

37Jesus declared, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’


## Matthew 22:38 (id: 140022038)

38This is the first and greatest commandment.


## Matthew 22:39 (id: 140022039)

39And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’


## Matthew 22:40 (id: 140022040)

40All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”


## Matthew 22:41 (id: 140022041)

41While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus questioned them:


## Matthew 22:42 (id: 140022042)

42“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?” “David’s,” they answered.


## Matthew 22:43 (id: 140022043)

43Jesus said to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord’? For he says:


## Matthew 22:44 (id: 140022044)

44‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet.”’


## Matthew 22:45 (id: 140022045)

45So if David calls Him ‘Lord,’ how can He be David’s son?”


## Matthew 22:46 (id: 140022046)

46No one was able to answer a word, and from that day on no one dared to question Him any further.


## Matthew 23:1 (id: 140023001)

1Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples:


## Matthew 23:2 (id: 140023002)

2“The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.


## Matthew 23:3 (id: 140023003)

3So practice and observe everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.


## Matthew 23:4 (id: 140023004)

4They tie up heavy, burdensome loads and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.


## Matthew 23:5 (id: 140023005)

5All their deeds are done for men to see. They broaden their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels.


## Matthew 23:6 (id: 140023006)

6They love the places of honor at banquets, the chief seats in the synagogues,


## Matthew 23:7 (id: 140023007)

7the greetings in the marketplaces, and the title of ‘Rabbi’ by which they are addressed.


## Matthew 23:8 (id: 140023008)

8But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.


## Matthew 23:9 (id: 140023009)

9And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.


## Matthew 23:10 (id: 140023010)

10Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Christ.


## Matthew 23:11 (id: 140023011)

11The greatest among you shall be your servant.


## Matthew 23:12 (id: 140023012)

12For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.


## Matthew 23:13 (id: 140023013)

13Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let in those who wish to enter.


## Matthew 23:15 (id: 140023015)

15Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You traverse land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.


## Matthew 23:16 (id: 140023016)

16Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.’


## Matthew 23:17 (id: 140023017)

17You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes it sacred?


## Matthew 23:18 (id: 140023018)

18And you say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.’


## Matthew 23:19 (id: 140023019)

19You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes it sacred?


## Matthew 23:20 (id: 140023020)

20So then, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.


## Matthew 23:21 (id: 140023021)

21And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the One who dwells in it.


## Matthew 23:22 (id: 140023022)

22And he who swears by heaven swears by God’s throne and by the One who sits on it.


## Matthew 23:23 (id: 140023023)

23Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You pay tithes of mint, dill, and cumin. But you have disregarded the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.


## Matthew 23:24 (id: 140023024)

24You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.


## Matthew 23:25 (id: 140023025)

25Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self\-indulgence.


## Matthew 23:26 (id: 140023026)

26Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside may become clean as well.


## Matthew 23:27 (id: 140023027)

27Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men’s bones and every kind of impurity.


## Matthew 23:28 (id: 140023028)

28In the same way, on the outside you appear to be righteous, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.


## Matthew 23:29 (id: 140023029)

29Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous.


## Matthew 23:30 (id: 140023030)

30And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’


## Matthew 23:31 (id: 140023031)

31So you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.


## Matthew 23:32 (id: 140023032)

32Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your fathers.


## Matthew 23:33 (id: 140023033)

33You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape the sentence of hell?


## Matthew 23:34 (id: 140023034)

34Because of this, I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and others you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town.


## Matthew 23:35 (id: 140023035)

35And so upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.


## Matthew 23:36 (id: 140023036)

36Truly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation.


## Matthew 23:37 (id: 140023037)

37O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!


## Matthew 23:38 (id: 140023038)

38Look, your house is left to you desolate.


## Matthew 23:39 (id: 140023039)

39For I tell you that you will not see Me again until you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’”


## Matthew 24:1 (id: 140024001)

1As Jesus left the temple and was walking away, His disciples came up to Him to point out its buildings.


## Matthew 24:2 (id: 140024002)

2“Do you see all these things?” He replied. “Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”


## Matthew 24:3 (id: 140024003)

3While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?”


## Matthew 24:4 (id: 140024004)

4Jesus answered, “See to it that no one deceives you.


## Matthew 24:5 (id: 140024005)

5For many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many.


## Matthew 24:6 (id: 140024006)

6You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come.


## Matthew 24:7 (id: 140024007)

7Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.


## Matthew 24:8 (id: 140024008)

8All these are the beginning of birth pains.


## Matthew 24:9 (id: 140024009)

9Then they will deliver you over to be persecuted and killed, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.


## Matthew 24:10 (id: 140024010)

10At that time many will fall away and will betray and hate one another,


## Matthew 24:11 (id: 140024011)

11and many false prophets will arise and deceive many.


## Matthew 24:12 (id: 140024012)

12Because of the multiplication of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold.


## Matthew 24:13 (id: 140024013)

13But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.


## Matthew 24:14 (id: 140024014)

14And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.


## Matthew 24:15 (id: 140024015)

15So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand),


## Matthew 24:16 (id: 140024016)

16then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.


## Matthew 24:17 (id: 140024017)

17Let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve anything from his house.


## Matthew 24:18 (id: 140024018)

18And let no one in the field return for his cloak.


## Matthew 24:19 (id: 140024019)

19How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers!


## Matthew 24:20 (id: 140024020)

20Pray that your flight will not occur in the winter or on the Sabbath.


## Matthew 24:21 (id: 140024021)

21For at that time there will be great tribulation, unseen from the beginning of the world until now, and never to be seen again.


## Matthew 24:22 (id: 140024022)

22If those days had not been cut short, nobody would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be cut short.


## Matthew 24:23 (id: 140024023)

23At that time, if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There He is!’ do not believe it.


## Matthew 24:24 (id: 140024024)

24For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive even the elect, if that were possible.


## Matthew 24:25 (id: 140024025)

25See, I have told you in advance.


## Matthew 24:26 (id: 140024026)

26So if they tell you, ‘There He is, in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or, ‘Here He is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.


## Matthew 24:27 (id: 140024027)

27For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.


## Matthew 24:28 (id: 140024028)

28Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.


## Matthew 24:29 (id: 140024029)

29Immediately after the tribulation of those days: ‘The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.’


## Matthew 24:30 (id: 140024030)

30At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.


## Matthew 24:31 (id: 140024031)

31And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.


## Matthew 24:32 (id: 140024032)

32Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves, you know that summer is near.


## Matthew 24:33 (id: 140024033)

33So also, when you see all these things, you will know that He is near, right at the door.


## Matthew 24:34 (id: 140024034)

34Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.


## Matthew 24:35 (id: 140024035)

35Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.


## Matthew 24:36 (id: 140024036)

36No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.


## Matthew 24:37 (id: 140024037)

37As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.


## Matthew 24:38 (id: 140024038)

38For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark.


## Matthew 24:39 (id: 140024039)

39And they were oblivious until the flood came and swept them all away. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.


## Matthew 24:40 (id: 140024040)

40Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.


## Matthew 24:41 (id: 140024041)

41Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.


## Matthew 24:42 (id: 140024042)

42Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day on which your Lord will come.


## Matthew 24:43 (id: 140024043)

43But understand this: If the homeowner had known in which watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.


## Matthew 24:44 (id: 140024044)

44For this reason, you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.


## Matthew 24:45 (id: 140024045)

45Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of his household, to give the others their food at the proper time?


## Matthew 24:46 (id: 140024046)

46Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.


## Matthew 24:47 (id: 140024047)

47Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.


## Matthew 24:48 (id: 140024048)

48But suppose that servant is wicked and says in his heart, ‘My master will be away a long time.’


## Matthew 24:49 (id: 140024049)

49And he begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.


## Matthew 24:50 (id: 140024050)

50The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not anticipate.


## Matthew 24:51 (id: 140024051)

51Then he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.


## Matthew 25:1 (id: 140025001)

1“At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.


## Matthew 25:2 (id: 140025002)

2Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.


## Matthew 25:3 (id: 140025003)

3The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take along any extra oil.


## Matthew 25:4 (id: 140025004)

4But the wise ones took oil in flasks along with their lamps.


## Matthew 25:5 (id: 140025005)

5When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.


## Matthew 25:6 (id: 140025006)

6At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’


## Matthew 25:7 (id: 140025007)

7Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.


## Matthew 25:8 (id: 140025008)

8The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’


## Matthew 25:9 (id: 140025009)

9‘No,’ said the wise ones, ‘or there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’


## Matthew 25:10 (id: 140025010)

10But while they were on their way to buy it, the bridegroom arrived. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet, and the door was shut.


## Matthew 25:11 (id: 140025011)

11Later the other virgins arrived and said, ‘Lord, lord, open the door for us!’


## Matthew 25:12 (id: 140025012)

12But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I do not know you.’


## Matthew 25:13 (id: 140025013)

13Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.


## Matthew 25:14 (id: 140025014)

14For it is just like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted them with his possessions.


## Matthew 25:15 (id: 140025015)

15To one he gave five talents, to another two talents, and to another one talent—each according to his own ability. And he went on his journey.


## Matthew 25:16 (id: 140025016)

16The servant who had received the five talents went at once and put them to work and gained five more.


## Matthew 25:17 (id: 140025017)

17Likewise, the one with the two talents gained two more.


## Matthew 25:18 (id: 140025018)

18But the servant who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.


## Matthew 25:19 (id: 140025019)

19After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.


## Matthew 25:20 (id: 140025020)

20The servant who had received the five talents came and presented five more. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’


## Matthew 25:21 (id: 140025021)

21His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’


## Matthew 25:22 (id: 140025022)

22The servant who had received the two talents also came and said, ‘Master, you entrusted me with two talents. See, I have gained two more.’


## Matthew 25:23 (id: 140025023)

23His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’


## Matthew 25:24 (id: 140025024)

24Finally, the servant who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Master, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.


## Matthew 25:25 (id: 140025025)

25So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what belongs to you.’


## Matthew 25:26 (id: 140025026)

26‘You wicked, lazy servant!’ replied his master. ‘You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed.


## Matthew 25:27 (id: 140025027)

27Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received it back with interest.


## Matthew 25:28 (id: 140025028)

28Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents.


## Matthew 25:29 (id: 140025029)

29For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.


## Matthew 25:30 (id: 140025030)

30And throw that worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’


## Matthew 25:31 (id: 140025031)

31When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne.


## Matthew 25:32 (id: 140025032)

32All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate the people one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.


## Matthew 25:33 (id: 140025033)

33He will place the sheep on His right and the goats on His left.


## Matthew 25:34 (id: 140025034)

34Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.


## Matthew 25:35 (id: 140025035)

35For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you took Me in,


## Matthew 25:36 (id: 140025036)

36I was naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you looked after Me, I was in prison and you visited Me.’


## Matthew 25:37 (id: 140025037)

37Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You something to drink?


## Matthew 25:38 (id: 140025038)

38When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?


## Matthew 25:39 (id: 140025039)

39When did we see You sick or in prison and visit You?’


## Matthew 25:40 (id: 140025040)

40And the King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.’


## Matthew 25:41 (id: 140025041)

41Then He will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.


## Matthew 25:42 (id: 140025042)

42For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink,


## Matthew 25:43 (id: 140025043)

43I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after Me.’


## Matthew 25:44 (id: 140025044)

44And they too will reply, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’


## Matthew 25:45 (id: 140025045)

45Then the King will answer, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.’


## Matthew 25:46 (id: 140025046)

46And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”


## Matthew 26:1 (id: 140026001)

1When Jesus had finished saying all these things, He told His disciples,


## Matthew 26:2 (id: 140026002)

2“You know that the Passover is two days away, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”


## Matthew 26:3 (id: 140026003)

3At that time the chief priests and elders of the people assembled in the courtyard of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,


## Matthew 26:4 (id: 140026004)

4and they conspired to arrest Jesus covertly and kill Him.


## Matthew 26:5 (id: 140026005)

5“But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.”


## Matthew 26:6 (id: 140026006)

6While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper,


## Matthew 26:7 (id: 140026007)

7a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, which she poured on His head as He reclined at the table.


## Matthew 26:8 (id: 140026008)

8When the disciples saw this, they were indignant and asked, “Why this waste?


## Matthew 26:9 (id: 140026009)

9This perfume could have been sold at a high price, and the money given to the poor.”


## Matthew 26:10 (id: 140026010)

10Aware of this, Jesus asked, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful deed to Me.


## Matthew 26:11 (id: 140026011)

11The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me.


## Matthew 26:12 (id: 140026012)

12By pouring this perfume on Me, she has prepared My body for burial.


## Matthew 26:13 (id: 140026013)

13Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”


## Matthew 26:14 (id: 140026014)

14Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests


## Matthew 26:15 (id: 140026015)

15and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?” And they set out for him thirty pieces of silver.


## Matthew 26:16 (id: 140026016)

16So from then on Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus.


## Matthew 26:17 (id: 140026017)

17On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”


## Matthew 26:18 (id: 140026018)

18He answered, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him that the Teacher says, ‘My time is near. I will keep the Passover with My disciples at your house.’”


## Matthew 26:19 (id: 140026019)

19So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.


## Matthew 26:20 (id: 140026020)

20When evening came, Jesus was reclining with the twelve disciples.


## Matthew 26:21 (id: 140026021)

21And while they were eating, He said to them, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”


## Matthew 26:22 (id: 140026022)

22They were deeply grieved and began to ask Him one after another, “Surely not I, Lord?”


## Matthew 26:23 (id: 140026023)

23Jesus answered, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with Me will betray Me.


## Matthew 26:24 (id: 140026024)

24The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed. It would be better for him if he had not been born.”


## Matthew 26:25 (id: 140026025)

25Then Judas, who would betray Him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “You have said it yourself.”


## Matthew 26:26 (id: 140026026)

26While they were eating, Jesus took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is My body.”


## Matthew 26:27 (id: 140026027)

27Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you.


## Matthew 26:28 (id: 140026028)

28This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.


## Matthew 26:29 (id: 140026029)

29I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in My Father’s kingdom.”


## Matthew 26:30 (id: 140026030)

30And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.


## Matthew 26:31 (id: 140026031)

31Then Jesus said to them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of Me. For it is written: ‘I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’


## Matthew 26:32 (id: 140026032)

32But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”


## Matthew 26:33 (id: 140026033)

33Peter said to Him, “Even if all fall away on account of You, I never will.”


## Matthew 26:34 (id: 140026034)

34“Truly I tell you,” Jesus declared, “this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”


## Matthew 26:35 (id: 140026035)

35Peter replied, “Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the other disciples said the same thing.


## Matthew 26:36 (id: 140026036)

36Then Jesus went with His disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and He told them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”


## Matthew 26:37 (id: 140026037)

37He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.


## Matthew 26:38 (id: 140026038)

38Then He said to them, “My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me.”


## Matthew 26:39 (id: 140026039)

39Going a little farther, He fell facedown and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will.”


## Matthew 26:40 (id: 140026040)

40Then Jesus returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. “Were you not able to keep watch with Me for one hour?” He asked Peter.


## Matthew 26:41 (id: 140026041)

41“Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”


## Matthew 26:42 (id: 140026042)

42A second time He went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, may Your will be done.”


## Matthew 26:43 (id: 140026043)

43And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.


## Matthew 26:44 (id: 140026044)

44So He left them and went away once more and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.


## Matthew 26:45 (id: 140026045)

45Then He returned to the disciples and said, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.


## Matthew 26:46 (id: 140026046)

46Rise, let us go! See, My betrayer is approaching!”


## Matthew 26:47 (id: 140026047)

47While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.


## Matthew 26:48 (id: 140026048)

48Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him.”


## Matthew 26:49 (id: 140026049)

49Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.


## Matthew 26:50 (id: 140026050)

50“Friend,” Jesus replied, “do what you came for.” Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested Him.


## Matthew 26:51 (id: 140026051)

51At this, one of Jesus’ companions drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.


## Matthew 26:52 (id: 140026052)

52“Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him. “For all who draw the sword will die by the sword.


## Matthew 26:53 (id: 140026053)

53Are you not aware that I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?


## Matthew 26:54 (id: 140026054)

54But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?”


## Matthew 26:55 (id: 140026055)

55At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw? Every day I sat teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest Me.


## Matthew 26:56 (id: 140026056)

56But this has all happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.


## Matthew 26:57 (id: 140026057)

57Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders had gathered.


## Matthew 26:58 (id: 140026058)

58But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went in and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.


## Matthew 26:59 (id: 140026059)

59Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death.


## Matthew 26:60 (id: 140026060)

60But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward


## Matthew 26:61 (id: 140026061)

61and declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”


## Matthew 26:62 (id: 140026062)

62So the high priest stood up and asked Him, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?”


## Matthew 26:63 (id: 140026063)

63But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.”


## Matthew 26:64 (id: 140026064)

64“You have said it yourself,” Jesus answered. “But I say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”


## Matthew 26:65 (id: 140026065)

65At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.


## Matthew 26:66 (id: 140026066)

66What do you think?” “He deserves to die,” they answered.


## Matthew 26:67 (id: 140026067)

67Then they spit in His face and struck Him. Others slapped Him


## Matthew 26:68 (id: 140026068)

68and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?”


## Matthew 26:69 (id: 140026069)

69Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You also were with Jesus the Galilean,” she said.


## Matthew 26:70 (id: 140026070)

70But he denied it before them all: “I do not know what you are talking about.”


## Matthew 26:71 (id: 140026071)

71When Peter had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”


## Matthew 26:72 (id: 140026072)

72And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”


## Matthew 26:73 (id: 140026073)

73After a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter. “Surely you are one of them,” they said, “for your accent gives you away.”


## Matthew 26:74 (id: 140026074)

74At that he began to curse and swear to them, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.


## Matthew 26:75 (id: 140026075)

75Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.


## Matthew 27:1 (id: 140027001)

1When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people conspired against Jesus to put Him to death.


## Matthew 27:2 (id: 140027002)

2They bound Him, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate the governor.


## Matthew 27:3 (id: 140027003)

3When Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was filled with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.


## Matthew 27:4 (id: 140027004)

4“I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,” he said. “What is that to us?” they replied. “You bear the responsibility.”


## Matthew 27:5 (id: 140027005)

5So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.


## Matthew 27:6 (id: 140027006)

6The chief priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is unlawful to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.”


## Matthew 27:7 (id: 140027007)

7After conferring together, they used the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.


## Matthew 27:8 (id: 140027008)

8That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.


## Matthew 27:9 (id: 140027009)

9Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on Him by the people of Israel,


## Matthew 27:10 (id: 140027010)

10and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord had commanded me.”


## Matthew 27:11 (id: 140027011)

11Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, who questioned Him: “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.


## Matthew 27:12 (id: 140027012)

12And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He gave no answer.


## Matthew 27:13 (id: 140027013)

13Then Pilate asked Him, “Do You not hear how many charges they are bringing against You?”


## Matthew 27:14 (id: 140027014)

14But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge, much to the governor’s amazement.


## Matthew 27:15 (id: 140027015)

15Now it was the governor’s custom at the feast to release to the crowd a prisoner of their choosing.


## Matthew 27:16 (id: 140027016)

16At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.


## Matthew 27:17 (id: 140027017)

17So when the crowd had assembled, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”


## Matthew 27:18 (id: 140027018)

18For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.


## Matthew 27:19 (id: 140027019)

19While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered terribly in a dream today because of Him.”


## Matthew 27:20 (id: 140027020)

20But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.


## Matthew 27:21 (id: 140027021)

21“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. “Barabbas,” they replied.


## Matthew 27:22 (id: 140027022)

22“What then should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify Him!”


## Matthew 27:23 (id: 140027023)

23“Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!”


## Matthew 27:24 (id: 140027024)

24When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that instead a riot was breaking out, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “You bear the responsibility.”


## Matthew 27:25 (id: 140027025)

25All the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”


## Matthew 27:26 (id: 140027026)

26So Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified.


## Matthew 27:27 (id: 140027027)

27Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company around Him.


## Matthew 27:28 (id: 140027028)

28They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.


## Matthew 27:29 (id: 140027029)

29And they twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on His head. They put a staff in His right hand, knelt down before Him, and mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”


## Matthew 27:30 (id: 140027030)

30Then they spit on Him and took the staff and struck Him on the head repeatedly.


## Matthew 27:31 (id: 140027031)

31After they had mocked Him, they removed the robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him away to crucify Him.


## Matthew 27:32 (id: 140027032)

32Along the way they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.


## Matthew 27:33 (id: 140027033)

33And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull,


## Matthew 27:34 (id: 140027034)

34they offered Him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, He refused to drink it.


## Matthew 27:35 (id: 140027035)

35When they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments by casting lots.


## Matthew 27:36 (id: 140027036)

36And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.


## Matthew 27:37 (id: 140027037)

37Above His head they posted the written charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.


## Matthew 27:38 (id: 140027038)

38Two robbers were crucified with Him, one on His right and the other on His left.


## Matthew 27:39 (id: 140027039)

39And those who passed by heaped abuse on Him, shaking their heads


## Matthew 27:40 (id: 140027040)

40and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”


## Matthew 27:41 (id: 140027041)

41In the same way, the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked Him, saying,


## Matthew 27:42 (id: 140027042)

42“He saved others, but He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel! Let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him.


## Matthew 27:43 (id: 140027043)

43He trusts in God. Let God deliver Him now if He wants Him. For He said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”


## Matthew 27:44 (id: 140027044)

44In the same way, even the robbers who were crucified with Him berated Him.


## Matthew 27:45 (id: 140027045)

45From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.


## Matthew 27:46 (id: 140027046)

46About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”


## Matthew 27:47 (id: 140027047)

47When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He is calling Elijah.”


## Matthew 27:48 (id: 140027048)

48One of them quickly ran and brought a sponge. He filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and held it up for Jesus to drink.


## Matthew 27:49 (id: 140027049)

49But the others said, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to save Him.”


## Matthew 27:50 (id: 140027050)

50When Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, He yielded up His spirit.


## Matthew 27:51 (id: 140027051)

51At that moment the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked, and the rocks were split.


## Matthew 27:52 (id: 140027052)

52The tombs broke open, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.


## Matthew 27:53 (id: 140027053)

53After Jesus’ resurrection, when they had come out of the tombs, they entered the holy city and appeared to many people.


## Matthew 27:54 (id: 140027054)

54When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this was the Son of God.”


## Matthew 27:55 (id: 140027055)

55And many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to minister to Him.


## Matthew 27:56 (id: 140027056)

56Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.


## Matthew 27:57 (id: 140027057)

57When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who himself was a disciple of Jesus.


## Matthew 27:58 (id: 140027058)

58He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.


## Matthew 27:59 (id: 140027059)

59So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,


## Matthew 27:60 (id: 140027060)

60and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance to the tomb and went away.


## Matthew 27:61 (id: 140027061)

61Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.


## Matthew 27:62 (id: 140027062)

62The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and Pharisees assembled before Pilate.


## Matthew 27:63 (id: 140027063)

63“Sir,” they said, “we remember that while He was alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’


## Matthew 27:64 (id: 140027064)

64So give the order that the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise, His disciples may come and steal Him away and tell the people He has risen from the dead. And this last deception would be worse than the first.”


## Matthew 27:65 (id: 140027065)

65“You have a guard,” Pilate said. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.”


## Matthew 27:66 (id: 140027066)

66So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard.


## Matthew 28:1 (id: 140028001)

1After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.


## Matthew 28:2 (id: 140028002)

2Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.


## Matthew 28:3 (id: 140028003)

3His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.


## Matthew 28:4 (id: 140028004)

4The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.


## Matthew 28:5 (id: 140028005)

5But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.


## Matthew 28:6 (id: 140028006)

6He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay.


## Matthew 28:7 (id: 140028007)

7Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.”


## Matthew 28:8 (id: 140028008)

8So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.


## Matthew 28:9 (id: 140028009)

9Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him.


## Matthew 28:10 (id: 140028010)

10“Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”


## Matthew 28:11 (id: 140028011)

11While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.


## Matthew 28:12 (id: 140028012)

12And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money


## Matthew 28:13 (id: 140028013)

13and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’


## Matthew 28:14 (id: 140028014)

14If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”


## Matthew 28:15 (id: 140028015)

15So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.


## Matthew 28:16 (id: 140028016)

16Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated.


## Matthew 28:17 (id: 140028017)

17When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted.


## Matthew 28:18 (id: 140028018)

18Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.


## Matthew 28:19 (id: 140028019)

19Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,


## Matthew 28:20 (id: 140028020)

20and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”
