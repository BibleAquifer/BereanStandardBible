## Nahum 1:1 (id: 134001001)

1This is the burden against Nineveh, the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:


## Nahum 1:2 (id: 134001002)

2The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD is avenging and full of wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on His foes and reserves wrath for His enemies.


## Nahum 1:3 (id: 134001003)

3The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.


## Nahum 1:4 (id: 134001004)

4He rebukes the sea and dries it up; He makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the flower of Lebanon wilts.


## Nahum 1:5 (id: 134001005)

5The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt away; the earth trembles at His presence—the world and all its dwellers.


## Nahum 1:6 (id: 134001006)

6Who can withstand His indignation? Who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; even rocks are shattered before Him.


## Nahum 1:7 (id: 134001007)

7The LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of distress; He cares for those who trust in Him.


## Nahum 1:8 (id: 134001008)

8But with an overwhelming flood He will make an end of Nineveh and pursue His enemies into darkness.


## Nahum 1:9 (id: 134001009)

9Whatever you plot against the LORD, He will bring to an end. Affliction will not rise up a second time.


## Nahum 1:10 (id: 134001010)

10For they will be entangled as with thorns and consumed like the drink of a drunkard—like stubble that is fully dry.


## Nahum 1:11 (id: 134001011)

11From you, O Nineveh, comes forth a plotter of evil against the LORD, a counselor of wickedness.


## Nahum 1:12 (id: 134001012)

12This is what the LORD says: “Though they are allied and numerous, yet they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, O Judah, I will afflict you no longer.


## Nahum 1:13 (id: 134001013)

13For I will now break their yoke from your neck and tear away your shackles.”


## Nahum 1:14 (id: 134001014)

14The LORD has issued a command concerning you, O Nineveh: “There will be no descendants to carry on your name. I will cut off the carved image and cast idol from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible.”


## Nahum 1:15 (id: 134001015)

15Look to the mountains—the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked will never again march through you; they will be utterly cut off.


## Nahum 2:1 (id: 134002001)

1One who scatters advances against you, O Nineveh. Guard the fortress! Watch the road! Brace yourselves! Summon all your strength!


## Nahum 2:2 (id: 134002002)

2For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and ruined the branches of their vine.


## Nahum 2:3 (id: 134002003)

3The shields of his mighty men are red; the valiant warriors are dressed in scarlet. The fittings of the chariots flash like fire on the day they are prepared, and the spears of cypress have been brandished.


## Nahum 2:4 (id: 134002004)

4The chariots dash through the streets; they rush around the plazas, appearing like torches, darting about like lightning.


## Nahum 2:5 (id: 134002005)

5He summons his nobles; they stumble as they advance. They race to its wall; the protective shield is set in place.


## Nahum 2:6 (id: 134002006)

6The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.


## Nahum 2:7 (id: 134002007)

7It is decreed that the city be exiled and carried away; her maidservants moan like doves, and beat upon their breasts.


## Nahum 2:8 (id: 134002008)

8Nineveh has been like a pool of water throughout her days, but now it is draining away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back.


## Nahum 2:9 (id: 134002009)

9“Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!” There is no end to the treasure, an abundance of every precious thing.


## Nahum 2:10 (id: 134002010)

10She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and laid waste! Hearts melt, knees knock, bodies tremble, and every face grows pale!


## Nahum 2:11 (id: 134002011)

11Where is the lions’ lair or the feeding ground of the young lions, where the lion and lioness prowled with their cubs, with nothing to frighten them away?


## Nahum 2:12 (id: 134002012)

12The lion mauled enough for its cubs and strangled prey for the lioness. It filled its dens with the kill, and its lairs with mauled prey.


## Nahum 2:13 (id: 134002013)

13“Behold, I am against you,” declares the LORD of Hosts. “I will reduce your chariots to cinders, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”


## Nahum 3:1 (id: 134003001)

1Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without prey.


## Nahum 3:2 (id: 134003002)

2The crack of the whip, the rumble of the wheel, galloping horse and bounding chariot!


## Nahum 3:3 (id: 134003003)

3Charging horseman, flashing sword, shining spear; heaps of slain, mounds of corpses, dead bodies without end—they stumble over their dead—


## Nahum 3:4 (id: 134003004)

4because of the many harlotries of the harlot, the seductive mistress of sorcery, who betrays nations by her prostitution and clans by her witchcraft.


## Nahum 3:5 (id: 134003005)

5“Behold, I am against you,” declares the LORD of Hosts. “I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show your nakedness to the nations and your shame to the kingdoms.


## Nahum 3:6 (id: 134003006)

6I will pelt you with filth and treat you with contempt; I will make a spectacle of you.


## Nahum 3:7 (id: 134003007)

7Then all who see you will recoil from you and say, ‘Nineveh is devastated; who will grieve for her?’ Where can I find comforters for you?”


## Nahum 3:8 (id: 134003008)

8Are you better than Thebes, stationed by the Nile with water around her, whose rampart was the sea, whose wall was the water?


## Nahum 3:9 (id: 134003009)

9Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength; Put and Libya were her allies.


## Nahum 3:10 (id: 134003010)

10Yet she became an exile; she went into captivity. Her infants were dashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her dignitaries, and all her nobles were bound in chains.


## Nahum 3:11 (id: 134003011)

11You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.


## Nahum 3:12 (id: 134003012)

12All your fortresses are fig trees with the first ripe figs; when shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater!


## Nahum 3:13 (id: 134003013)

13Look at your troops—they are like your women! The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire consumes their bars.


## Nahum 3:14 (id: 134003014)

14Draw your water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses. Work the clay and tread the mortar; repair the brick kiln!


## Nahum 3:15 (id: 134003015)

15There the fire will devour you; the sword will cut you down and consume you like a young locust. Make yourself many like the young locust; make yourself many like the swarming locust!


## Nahum 3:16 (id: 134003016)

16You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars of the sky. The young locust strips the land and flies away.


## Nahum 3:17 (id: 134003017)

17Your guards are like the swarming locust, and your scribes like clouds of locusts that settle on the walls on a cold day. When the sun rises, they fly away, and no one knows where.


## Nahum 3:18 (id: 134003018)

18O king of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your officers sleep. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.


## Nahum 3:19 (id: 134003019)

19There is no healing for your injury; your wound is severe. All who hear the news of you applaud your downfall, for who has not experienced your constant cruelty?
