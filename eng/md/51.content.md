## Colossians 1:1 (id: 151001001)

1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,


## Colossians 1:2 (id: 151001002)

2To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace and peace to you from God our Father.


## Colossians 1:3 (id: 151001003)

3We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,


## Colossians 1:4 (id: 151001004)

4because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all the saints—


## Colossians 1:5 (id: 151001005)

5the faith and love proceeding from the hope stored up for you in heaven, of which you have already heard in the word of truth, the gospel


## Colossians 1:6 (id: 151001006)

6that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood the grace of God.


## Colossians 1:7 (id: 151001007)

7You learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,


## Colossians 1:8 (id: 151001008)

8and who also informed us of your love in the Spirit.


## Colossians 1:9 (id: 151001009)

9For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,


## Colossians 1:10 (id: 151001010)

10so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord and may please Him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,


## Colossians 1:11 (id: 151001011)

11being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might so that you may have full endurance and patience, and joyfully


## Colossians 1:12 (id: 151001012)

12giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.


## Colossians 1:13 (id: 151001013)

13He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of His beloved Son,


## Colossians 1:14 (id: 151001014)

14in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.


## Colossians 1:15 (id: 151001015)

15The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.


## Colossians 1:16 (id: 151001016)

16For in Him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created through Him and for Him.


## Colossians 1:17 (id: 151001017)

17He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.


## Colossians 1:18 (id: 151001018)

18And He is the head of the body, the church; He is the beginning and firstborn from among the dead, so that in all things He may have preeminence.


## Colossians 1:19 (id: 151001019)

19For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him,


## Colossians 1:20 (id: 151001020)

20and through Him to reconcile to Himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through the blood of His cross.


## Colossians 1:21 (id: 151001021)

21Once you were alienated from God and were hostile in your minds, engaging in evil deeds.


## Colossians 1:22 (id: 151001022)

22But now He has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy, unblemished, and blameless in His presence—


## Colossians 1:23 (id: 151001023)

23if indeed you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope of the gospel you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.


## Colossians 1:24 (id: 151001024)

24Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions for the sake of His body, which is the church.


## Colossians 1:25 (id: 151001025)

25I became its servant by the commission God gave me to fully proclaim to you the word of God,


## Colossians 1:26 (id: 151001026)

26the mystery that was hidden for ages and generations but is now revealed to His saints.


## Colossians 1:27 (id: 151001027)

27To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.


## Colossians 1:28 (id: 151001028)

28We proclaim Him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.


## Colossians 1:29 (id: 151001029)

29To this end I also labor, striving with all His energy working powerfully within me.


## Colossians 2:1 (id: 151002001)

1For I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me face to face,


## Colossians 2:2 (id: 151002002)

2that they may be encouraged in heart, knit together in love, and filled with the full riches of complete understanding, so that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ,


## Colossians 2:3 (id: 151002003)

3in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.


## Colossians 2:4 (id: 151002004)

4I say this so that no one will deceive you by smooth rhetoric.


## Colossians 2:5 (id: 151002005)

5For although I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, and I delight to see your orderly condition and firm faith in Christ.


## Colossians 2:6 (id: 151002006)

6Therefore, just as you have received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to walk in Him,


## Colossians 2:7 (id: 151002007)

7rooted and built up in Him, established in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.


## Colossians 2:8 (id: 151002008)

8See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, which are based on human tradition and the spiritual forces of the world rather than on Christ.


## Colossians 2:9 (id: 151002009)

9For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily form.


## Colossians 2:10 (id: 151002010)

10And you have been made complete in Christ, who is the head over every ruler and authority.


## Colossians 2:11 (id: 151002011)

11In Him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of your sinful nature, with the circumcision performed by Christ and not by human hands.


## Colossians 2:12 (id: 151002012)

12And having been buried with Him in baptism, you were raised with Him through your faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead.


## Colossians 2:13 (id: 151002013)

13When you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our trespasses,


## Colossians 2:14 (id: 151002014)

14having canceled the debt ascribed to us in the decrees that stood against us. He took it away, nailing it to the cross!


## Colossians 2:15 (id: 151002015)

15And having disarmed the powers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.


## Colossians 2:16 (id: 151002016)

16Therefore let no one judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a feast, a New Moon, or a Sabbath.


## Colossians 2:17 (id: 151002017)

17These are a shadow of the things to come, but the body that casts it belongs to Christ.


## Colossians 2:18 (id: 151002018)

18Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you with speculation about what he has seen. Such a person is puffed up without basis by his unspiritual mind.


## Colossians 2:19 (id: 151002019)

19He has lost connection to the head, from whom the whole body, supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments, grows as God causes it to grow.


## Colossians 2:20 (id: 151002020)

20If you have died with Christ to the spiritual forces of the world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its regulations:


## Colossians 2:21 (id: 151002021)

21“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!”?


## Colossians 2:22 (id: 151002022)

22These will all perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.


## Colossians 2:23 (id: 151002023)

23Such restrictions indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self\-prescribed worship, their false humility, and their harsh treatment of the body; but they are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh.


## Colossians 3:1 (id: 151003001)

1Therefore, since you have been raised with Christ, strive for the things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.


## Colossians 3:2 (id: 151003002)

2Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.


## Colossians 3:3 (id: 151003003)

3For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.


## Colossians 3:4 (id: 151003004)

4When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.


## Colossians 3:5 (id: 151003005)

5Put to death, therefore, the components of your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.


## Colossians 3:6 (id: 151003006)

6Because of these, the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.


## Colossians 3:7 (id: 151003007)

7When you lived among them, you also used to walk in these ways.


## Colossians 3:8 (id: 151003008)

8But now you must put aside all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.


## Colossians 3:9 (id: 151003009)

9Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off the old self with its practices,


## Colossians 3:10 (id: 151003010)

10and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.


## Colossians 3:11 (id: 151003011)

11Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all and is in all.


## Colossians 3:12 (id: 151003012)

12Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with hearts of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.


## Colossians 3:13 (id: 151003013)

13Bear with one another and forgive any complaint you may have against someone else. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.


## Colossians 3:14 (id: 151003014)

14And over all these virtues put on love, which is the bond of perfect unity.


## Colossians 3:15 (id: 151003015)

15Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, for to this you were called as members of one body. And be thankful.


## Colossians 3:16 (id: 151003016)

16Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.


## Colossians 3:17 (id: 151003017)

17And whatever you do, in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.


## Colossians 3:18 (id: 151003018)

18Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.


## Colossians 3:19 (id: 151003019)

19Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.


## Colossians 3:20 (id: 151003020)

20Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.


## Colossians 3:21 (id: 151003021)

21Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they will not become discouraged.


## Colossians 3:22 (id: 151003022)

22Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only to please them while they are watching, but with sincerity of heart and fear of the Lord.


## Colossians 3:23 (id: 151003023)

23Whatever you do, work at it with your whole being, as for the Lord and not for men,


## Colossians 3:24 (id: 151003024)

24because you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as your reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.


## Colossians 3:25 (id: 151003025)

25Whoever does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.


## Colossians 4:1 (id: 151004001)

1Masters, supply your slaves with what is right and fair, since you know that you also have a Master in heaven.


## Colossians 4:2 (id: 151004002)

2Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful,


## Colossians 4:3 (id: 151004003)

3as you pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.


## Colossians 4:4 (id: 151004004)

4Pray that I may declare it clearly, as I should.


## Colossians 4:5 (id: 151004005)

5Act wisely toward outsiders, redeeming the time.


## Colossians 4:6 (id: 151004006)

6Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.


## Colossians 4:7 (id: 151004007)

7Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a beloved brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord.


## Colossians 4:8 (id: 151004008)

8I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about us, and that he may encourage your hearts.


## Colossians 4:9 (id: 151004009)

9With him I am sending Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here.


## Colossians 4:10 (id: 151004010)

10My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you greetings, as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas. You have already received instructions about him: If he comes to you, welcome him.


## Colossians 4:11 (id: 151004011)

## Colossians 4:12 (id: 151004012)

12Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, so that you may stand mature and fully assured in the full will of God.
