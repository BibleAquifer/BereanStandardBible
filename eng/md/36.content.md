10On that day,” declares the LORD, “a cry will go up from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second District, and a loud crashing from the hills.

11Wail, O dwellers of the Hollow, for all your merchants will be silenced; all who weigh out silver will be cut off.

2before the decree takes effect and the day passes like chaff, before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you, before the Day of the LORD’s anger comes upon you.


## Zephaniah 2:3 (id: 136002003)
