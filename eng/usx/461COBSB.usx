<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" sid="1CO 4:9"/>For it seems to me that God has displayed us apostles at the end of the procession, like prisoners appointed for death. We have become a spectacle to the whole world, to angels as well as to men.<verse eid="1CO 4:9"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" sid="1CO 4:10"/>We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.<verse eid="1CO 4:10"/></para>
